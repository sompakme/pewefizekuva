Since the release of his debut album in 1999, Eminem has proved himself to be one of the best in the rap game. Today, he is ranked one of the best-selling artists and songwriters of all time. With 15 Grammy Awards, 17 Billboard Music Awards, eight American Music Awards, and many more, there is no denying that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem has come a long way in his career</a>. What then is his relationship with LL Cool J like? Take a look!</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">An Inside Look At Kid Rock And Eminem's Relationship</a></span></p><h2 id=ll-cool-j-inspired-eminem-to-start-rapping><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>LL Cool J Inspired Eminem To Start Rapping</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Eminem</a> had a lot of influences growing up but the most prominent and talked about remains LL Cool J. In a video released in July 2021, the 48-year-old rapper recalled watching the music video to LL Cool J's 1987 track I'm Bad video and ascribed his decision to become a rapper to that video. He said:</p><p>"When I saw the “Bad” video, I was like, “the fuck?!” He had the whole package — the look, the swag, the chain, everything! You know, you just wanted to be LL Cool J. He was like the first rockstar of rap. I’m like, “Yo, I wanted that”. That is what actually made me want to rap."</p><p>Back in 2018, Eminem also admitted to studying LL Cool J's songwriting skills and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">obsessing over his diversity as a rapper</a>. With how exemplary he has turned out as a rapper, it is safe to say Eminem's obsession turned out to be good after all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=meeting-ll-cool-j-was-a-dream-come-true><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Meeting LL Cool J Was A Dream Come True</span></h2><p>Seeing that LL Cool J was an inspiration to Eminem, it comes as no surprise that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their first meeting was nothing void of excitement for the younger rapper</a>. The duo first met in 1999, shortly after the&nbsp;release of Eminem's debut Slim Shady and if Eminem's words are anything to go by, it was an intense experience for him. Even more mind-blowing for him was LL Cool J quoting lyrics from one of Eminem's songs. Speaking to LL Cool J on Rock the Bells talk show, Eminem said:</p><p>"You quoted a lyric back to me. You said, ‘Yo, how can I be white I don’t even exist.’ You quoting that lyric back to me, was like, I think I s**t myself.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> 10 Facts About Enimen And Lil Wayne's Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-both-multi-talented><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>&nbsp;They Are Both Multi-Talented</span></h2><p>Best known for&nbsp;his fast-paced rap and vulgar lyrics, Eminem is ranked one of the best-selling artists of all time. But <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">while he is no doubt a god in his own right</a>, Eminem does not restrict himself to music alone. His songwriting skills and acting skills have also come to play in the years since he broke into the entertainment industry. Similarly, LL Cool J has also proved himself to be a multi-talented act. From rapping to acting to record producing and entrepreneurship, he has proved himself to be a force to reckon with in the entertainment industry.</p><h2 id=they-exchange-gifts-sometimes><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>They Exchange Gifts...Sometimes</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After watching the I'm Bad music video, Eminem had two things on his mind...rap and the chain LL Cool J wore. And he wanted the two just as bad. Since they had not met in person at the time, Eminem's only option was to tell a mutual friend to ask LL Cool J where he got his chains from. In the end, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he got gifted the exact chains by LL Cool J</a>. In a documentary series for MTV's Behind The Scenes, Eminem relayed the story saying:</p><p>"Since I was a little kid, I always wanted a chain. I was recording with Rick Rubin, and I was like, “Yo, can you ask LL where he got his chains from?” So he had these made and sent them to me. These are the same two chains he’s wearing in the “[I’m] Bad” video. When I saw the “Bad” video, I was like, “What the fuck?!” He had the whole package — the look, the swag, the chain, everything!"</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rihanna And Eminem: 15 Surprising Facts About Their Friendship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-are-very-supportive-of-each-other><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>They Are Very Supportive Of Each Other</span></h2><p>Over the course of their individual careers, Eminem and LL Cool J have been highly supportive of each other.
