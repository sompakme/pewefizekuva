The two first met on the set of Marvel's Spider-Man: Homecoming, where Tom famously played Spider-Man, aka Peter Parker, and Zendaya played his love interest, Michelle Jones Watson. The two were initially best friends, with Holland telling People Magazine that his co-star was an amazing person. Soon after, their friendship blossomed into romance, and they began dating.</p><p>Tom Holland and Zendaya are not just loved in Hollywood; fans adore them for their on-screen chemistry in Spider-Man and genuine affection for one another off-camera. As two of Tinseltown's most dazzling young stars, it's only natural that they've been in other relationships before they dated. For example, Zendaya was once rumored to have dated her Euphoria co-star Jacob Elordi. Tom has also been linked to several celebrities, including a British actress many called his first serious girlfriend before Zendaya...</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-tom-holland-date-nadia-parkes>Did Tom Holland Date Nadia Parkes?</h2><p>Ardent fans of Tom Holland might know that before Zendaya, there was allegedly another special lady in his life. The lady was British actress Nadia Parkes, and Holland appears to have dated her for quite some time. Although neither Nadia nor Tom officially confirmed or denied a romance, many clues suggest they were a couple.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tom-holland-s-rumored-first-love-wasn-t-zendaya-but-another-famous-actress.jpg><p>But just who is Nadia Parkes? The young star began her professional acting career on the Starz show The Spanish Princess as one of Queen Catherine of Aragon's ladies-in-waiting. Nadia then had a guest role in the popular British series Doctor Who. She has also starred in other works, such as the Netflix show The Bastard Son and the Devil Himself and the BBC comedy series Starstruck.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources close to the rumored couple stated that Holland and Parkes were introduced at an engagement party for one of Parkes' best friends, actress Sophie Turner and musician Joe Jonas. While details of their alleged romance are scarce, it was<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> reported in The Daily Mail </a>that Tom, his brother Harry, their friend Harrison, and Nadia all moved into a home together in London during the COVID-19 lockdown.</p><p>Not long after that, the usually secretive Tom Holland uploaded a photo of a young blonde woman on his Instagram account, who appeared to be Nadia Parkes, wearing a face mask. The actor captioned the photograph as "Stunning," immediately, fans and the media began to speculate whether the two were just friends or boyfriend and girlfriend. Later, Nadia would return the favor by posting a photo of Holland on the same platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-tom-holland-leave-nadia-parkes-to-date-zendaya>Did Tom Holland Leave Nadia Parkes To Date Zendaya?</h2><p>It's uncertain why Tom Holland and Nadia Parkes' romance or friendship ended, but the two suddenly stopped sharing updates about each other on social media.</p><p>It was always unlikely that Tom would go public with why he was no longer dating Parkes, judging by an interview he once gave to Esquire. In the interview, Holland explained that he usually didn't like to go public with his relationships because if they were to break up, he didn't want people to shame her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/zendaya-and-tom-holland.png><p>While Tom may have enjoyed a more low-key romance with Parkes, the same could not be said of his relationship with Zendaya. Given the latter's level of star power combined with Holland's, their romance was bound to come to light.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even before Holland met Nadia Parkes, he was friends and worked alongside Zendaya in the Spider-Man films. They were even rumored to be in a romance many years before they confirmed they were an item. But as Tom was supposedly dating Parkes, Zendaya was caught up in dating rumors with her Euphoria co-star Jacob Elordi, a romance neither denied nor confirmed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jacob-batalon-zendaya-and-tom-holland.png><p>During his supposed relationship with Nadia, the Spider-Man actor was accused of showing his affection for Zendaya after he tagged her in an Instagram photo in a suggestible place on a picture of himself. Fans then started to speculate that the two had a romantic relationship, and the media called him out on it and the situation on Instagram.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Did-Zendaya-And-Tom-Holland-Buy-A-Secret-Home-In-South-London.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Are Zendaya And Tom Holland Engaged?

He then implied that he was seeing someone other than Zendaya when he added that gossip like that could put someone in a difficult position if they were dating someone else. The scrutiny over what he posts online was a big reason why <a href=#>Holland would later quit social media</a>.</p><p>However, several months later, fans assumed that his supposed romance was over with Nadia after the paparazzi shared photos of him kissing Zendaya.</p><h2 id=how-did-nadia-parkes-handle-the-news-that-tom-holland-was-dating-zendaya>How Did Nadia Parkes Handle The News That Tom Holland Was Dating Zendaya?</h2><p>It's not easy for anyone to see their ex move on with someone else; it's undoubtedly worse for those in the public eye, especially when pictures and news articles about the relationship are plastered everywhere.
