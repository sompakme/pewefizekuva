So there’s a lot to tell.”</p><p>The subject came up as Lenz, who <a href=#>played Haley James Scott</a> on OTH from 2003 to 2012, and cohost <a href=#><strong>Sophia Bush</strong></a> were asked by guest<strong> Michaela McManus</strong> if they wanted to add author to their resumes. Their cohost <a href=#><strong>Hilarie Burton Morgan</strong></a> already wrote her first memoir, <a href=#>The Rural Diaries</a>, in 2020 with her follow-up, Grimoire Girl, set to hit bookshelves on October 3.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/One-Tree-Hill-Alum-Bethany-Joy-Lenz-Reveals-She-Was-in-a-Cult-for-10-Years-Hopes-to-Write-a-Book-252.jpg><p>Lenz said she “for sure” wants to pen a book one day and already has some pieces written. “I think the ADHD has made it really difficult over the years to — I have lots of essays and lots of chapters and things,” she explained. “But to really commit to putting it all together, I would love to write about my experience.”</p><p>The actress added that she worries about “the pressure of getting it right and everything having to be exactly real and all the people that are involved.”</p><p>She continued: “Also, I don’t know how much I can say because there are still people and legal things in place that make it more complicated for the timing of that. But I do write. I write all the time.”</p><p>Burton Morgan, 41, noted that Lenz can write about her experiences via song. “And I have,” the Everly frontwoman confirmed.</p><p>Lenz is no stranger to opening up about her personal life in an effort to help other people in similar situations. Previously, she played a memorable <a href=#>Grey’s Anatomy </a>character who was abused by her partner. Lenz was asked to play the role specifically because of her past.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/One-Tree-Hill-Alum-Bethany-Joy-Lenz-Reveals-She-Was-in-a-Cult-for-10-Years-Hopes-to-Write-a-Book-253-259.jpg><p>“I got a call from<a href=#> <strong>Krista Vernoff</strong></a>, who’s the showrunner of Grey’s Anatomy. … She knew a bit about my personal history. I’ve been in an abusive relationship before,” Lenz said during a 2018 appearance on <a href=#><strong>Steve Harvey</strong></a>‘s <a href=#>Steve</a>&nbsp;show. “I wasn’t physically abused, but it was very emotionally, psychologically and spiritually abusive in a lot of ways.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Guiding Light alum added that she wanted to play Jenny, her Grey’s Anatomy character, to show that abused women can be strong and smart — and sometimes not even realize they’re experiencing abuse.</p><p>“You’re so used to this toxic masculinity idea of ‘boys will be boys,’ or ‘oh, he just lost his temper.’ To share with an audience in that way — to see a woman who is really smart and successful and charismatic being abused — I hoped that people would relate to that and maybe some women who relate to that situation without even knowing it would find a relief … and then have a way to start to get out,” Lenz said at the time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaoppViwbOxxGafoqScqHqjsdOhmKexXZ%2B8unnLnqWzZaKaw6aty6xkrKCVYsSiv4yipWaZXZjCrcCMn6arZWFlerqxwKuqaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
