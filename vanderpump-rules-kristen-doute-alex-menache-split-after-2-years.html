“Moving day is hard,” the former Vanderpump Rules star, 39, captioned a sentimental Instagram Story selfie on Tuesday, January 21, while moving out of the home she and Menache briefly shared. “Leaving memories behind is even harder. Sending anyone having a DAY like this lots of love.”
Doute went on to call it a “really sad day,” tearfully thanking her “ride or die” friend Zack Wickham for helping pack up her things."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

One eagle-eyed social media user pointed out that the <a href=#>James Mae T-shirt designer</a> and Menache were no longer following each other on the platform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kristen-Doute-Splits-From-BF-Alex-Denies-Getting-Back-With-Ex-Carter-002.jpg><p>The <a href=#>former SUR employee</a> went on to address a few fans’ comments, explaining that her relationship with Menache simply “didn’t work out.” In screenshots shared by a <a href=#>Bravo fan account</a>, she added, “Alex is a wonderful man who I love and respect very much.”</p><p>When another user wondered whether Doute would get back together with <a href=#>off-on ex <strong>Brian Carter</strong></a>, who goes by his last name, the reality star shut down the rumors. “Carter and I are friends,” she replied. “Nothing more. Period. Everyone stop speculating.”</p><p><a href=#>Us Weekly broke the news</a> of Doute’s romance with Menache in April 2020, one month before they went Instagram official. “This makes my heart so happy! You deserve all the happiness in the world my love,” then-costar <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> gushed in May 2020. “You have such a big heart and always give and put others first! It’s YOUR turn to be happy!!!!! @menache2society ❤️❤️❤️ all the feels.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Later that month, the Michigan native <a href=#>shared more insight</a> into <a href=#>how she connected</a> with Menache. “I really took my time with Alex and I really had to just lay it all out there and say this is who I am. This is what I’ve been through. You have a choice to make and either way it’s cool,” she exclusively told Us, calling the drama-free relationship “refreshing.”</p><p>At the time, Doute was hopeful that fans would <a href=#>see more of Menache</a> on Vanderpump Rules, but she was fired in June 2020 for past racially insensitive behavior. <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong>, <strong>Max Boyens</strong> and<strong> Brett Caprioni</strong></a> were also axed by the network before <a href=#><strong>Jax Taylor</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Brittany Cartwright</strong></a> announced their exits.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGavmZ6ZsrO81KanZqqlobK0ecqroKyslaN6pbvUrZxmmZyaxW65xKeYnKCVYsCxuMitZJqepJq%2Fbn6MspyaqqNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
