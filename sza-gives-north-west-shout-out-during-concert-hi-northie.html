I love you so so so much,” Kardashian captioned the post, which included a carousel of photos of the mother-daughter duo.</p><p>SZA, for her part, is currently on her <a href=# rel=noopener>SOS Tour</a> and, after her performance at Summerfest will travel across the pond for shows in London on June 29 and Dublin on July 3. She will return to the United States for Lollapalooza in Chicago on August 2, before heading to Montreal for the Osheaga Music and Arts Festival on August 4.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before embarking on her tour, SZA started the year off strong by securing the award for Best R&B Song at the 2024 Grammy Awards in February for her song “Snooze.” SZA was the most-nominated artist at the Grammys this year, with a total of nine nominations and three wins. Her collaboration with <strong>Phoebe Bridgers</strong> on “Ghost in the Machine” won for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.</p><p>“I’m sorry, I’m just really overwhelmed. You don’t really understand, I came really, really far and I can’t believe this is happening. It feels very fake,” SZA said during <a href=#>her acceptance speech</a>. “I’m just very grateful. And I’m not an attractive crier. Thank you.”</p><p>Later in the night, “Snooze” won Best R&B Song while SOS won Best Progressive R&B Album.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasspFitKrCxKxkp6eiqbVuw8Ssq2armKTCtXnOrqtmnKWntq%2BzjJymp5uVp8FutMhmpaiqpJ22pns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
