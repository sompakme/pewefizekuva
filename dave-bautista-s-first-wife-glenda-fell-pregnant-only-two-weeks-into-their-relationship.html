But according to multiple reports, she's also a Filipino-American like Dave. She's also in the media industry. After getting a Bachelor of Arts Degree, majoring in English, Journalism, and Fine Arts, she completed her Masters in Business Administration and now works as Senior Director in Ad Products at Hearst Publishing. She used to occupy high-level positions at iHeart media, AdPrime Media, and AOL.</p><p>She married the <a href=#>Guardians of the Galaxy star</a> in 1990 and welcomed their daughter, Keilani a year later. In a now-deleted article by Amo Mama , Glenda reportedly fell pregnant, two weeks into the relationship. Two years later, they welcomed another daughter, Athena. The couple eventually divorced in 1998 after eight years of marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/fokbabmxsa0w3ek.jpeg><p>At that time, <a href=#>Dave's wrestling career</a> was just starting to take off. In 2002, he signed with then-Word Wrestling Federation (now WWE) under the ring name Batista. His first reign with the World Heavyweight Championship (282 days) is the longest reign for that title.</p><p>He made his way into acting and guest-starred in the <a href=#>TV series Smallville</a>, which he thought <a href=#>ended his shot in the field before even starting</a>. Thanks to a <a href=#>small role in Blade Runner 2049</a>, he went on to land bigger roles and hone his acting skills.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Meanwhile, Glenda has remarried to a man named Chris Baker since 2014. According to his LinkedIn page, he's a creative director at Zen Studios. Glenda's last name on Facebook is now Bautista-Baker. Though it's unclear whether she and Dave are still in touch, they also share grandkids — Aiden and Jacob — from Keilani.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Has Manny Pacquiao Responded To Dave Bautista's Criticisms (And Tattoo Cover Up) Of Him?</a></span></p><h2 id=who-are-dave-bautista-39-s-other-ex-wives>Who Are Dave Bautista's Other Ex-Wives?</h2><p>Dave married his second wife, Angie Bautista in 1998. Four years later, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. The actor stayed by her side during her treatment. Back then, Dave used his growing influence to raise funds for the Ovarian Cancer Research Alliance (OCRA). In 2010, four years after their divorce, he published a video promoting the cause on YouTube.</p><p>After their split, the two remained friends and even welcomed a son, Oliver a year later. That year, the <a href=#>Spectre star</a> also released his autobiography, Batista Unleashed. The two reportedly grew closer after the book was published. Angie and Oliver have stayed out of the limelight in the last years. But she's still doing well and is now working as a fitness supporter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar52395370.jpg><p>Dave waited almost a decade to get married again. In 2015, he married professional pole dancer, Sarah Jade Bautista, who's 18 years his junior. They dated for a few years before tying the knot. Sarah continued her profession throughout their marriage and was even named Miss Pole Dance America in 2016. These days, she still manages Buttercup Pole Dance, a studio which she opened in 2011. She and Dave divorced in 2019. The two never disclosed the reason for their split.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Until now, the actor still refuses to spill the details on his secret girlfriend. "'For the past two years, [Bautista] has been seeing someone he declines to name, who just gets him, man,'" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Larson of Men's Health</a> quoted a source close to the star in late 2021. "They met on a film, he says, and she understands the business and the limitations it brings to his personal life."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Stone Cold Steve Austin Gave Dave Bautista Career-Changing Advice On Which Hollywood Scripts He Needed To Avoid</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-dave-bautista-doing-now>What Is Dave Bautista Doing Now?</h2><p>After starring in <strong><a href=#>Netflix</a></strong>'s Glass Onion, the <strong><a href=#>MCU</a></strong> star is now <a href=#>retiring from his role as Drax in Guardians of the Galaxy</a>. During a <a href=#>new interview with GQ</a>, Dave said that there's "relief" in leaving the part. "I'm so grateful for Drax. I love him," he clarified. "But there's a relief [that it's over]. It wasn't all pleasant. It was hard playing that role. The <a href=#>makeup process</a> was beating me down. And I just don't know if I want Drax to be my legacy—it's a silly performance, and I want to do more dramatic stuff."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/instar50594754.jpg><p>He also said that he's not worried that quitting such an iconic character would decrease his popularity as an actor. "Honestly, I could give a f--- [about being a movie star]," he explained. "I don't care about the spotlight, I don't care about fame. I just want to be a better actor. I want respect from my peers. I don't need accolades—I really don't, man. It's about the experience, about knowing that I accomplished something."</p><p>He actually has <a href=#>many projects lined up</a> — all set to show his range as a serious actor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibmq6VYq%2BiwdOiqq2Zo2Kzqr7SrWSwoZaaeqi4xKebmmWWmrmtec%2BrnKCmkaPBbrvNpbBmrKekerixxKSqZqGeqbxuwMeeoKtlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
