Even before meeting Alec, she had been doing very well for herself, and through the years, she has single-handedly built an impressive net worth. Let's see how she's done it.</p><h2 id=who-is-hilaria-baldwin-and-how-much-is-she-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Who Is Hilaria Baldwin, And How Much Is She Worth?</span></h2><p>Hilaria Thomas Baldwin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Kathryn Hayward and David Thomas. Kathryn was an associate physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, while her dad was an attorney. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hilaria's parents founded an integrative health organization</a>, and considering the path she took in her career, it makes sense that she would come from a family that is mindful of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and helping others do the same. Hilaria is a yoga instructor and a wellness specialist, as well as an entrepreneur, and has amassed a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$10 million net worth</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-did-hilaria-meet-alec-baldwin><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>When Did Hilaria Meet Alec Baldwin?</span></h2><p>Hilaria met Alec Baldwin in 2011, and it was a completely random meeting. They were both at a restaurant in New York, and it was practically love at first sight. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I wandered into Pure Food and Wine on Irving Place, on an unseasonably warm February evening</a>," Alec shared with the world. "My friend, @bocartist (Brendan O’Connell) and I sat down (outside!) and as I turned to my left I saw a woman who would change my life. Entirely."</p><p>Apparently, he knew immediately that he wanted to be with her, and while it took Hilaria a bit by surprise, she liked him and decided to give him a chance. "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I was standing near the door with my friends when he walked up and took my hand and said, 'I must know you'</a>," Hilaria said. Alec gave her his card, and a couple of days later, she called him to go on a date.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-encouraged-hilaria-baldwin-to-pursue-her-career><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>What Encouraged Hilaria Baldwin To Pursue Her Career</span></h2><p>Hilaria built her incredible net worth by being, among other things, a very successful health practitioner. And while it's a genuine, positive passion of hers, it came from a very difficult period of her life. She struggled with an aggressive eating disorder, and after years of experiencing bad health, she found a way out through the work she still does to this day.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Hilaria Baldwin Replies To Haters Accusing Her Of Doing Parenting Wrong</a></span></p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I opened up about growing up with an eating disorder. I turned to yoga, health and wellness to heal my body and my mind</a>," she explained. "I think back to my old self and how much I would have struggled with gaining weight during pregnancy and being patient with healthfully losing it. I’m so happy I can be a strong and happy mommy now, completely accepting of my body."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-she-started-building-her-fortune><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How She Started Building Her Fortune</span></h2><p>Right after she graduated from New York University, Hilaria started her career as a yoga and wellness instructor by co-founding her yoga studio, Yoga Vida in the West Village. She had to work very hard, teaching 36 classes a week, but it paid off. Yoga Vida became a highly successful yoga studio, and she opened up four locations in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The profits of that successful first business venture were the first big contributors to her fortune</p><h2 id=hilaria-baldwin-39-s-work-in-the-entertainment-industry><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Hilaria Baldwin's Work In The Entertainment Industry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After marrying Alec, Hilaria Baldwin dabbled in showbusiness.

It did very well and received great reviews. In the book, she shares advice and tips, as well as telling stories about both tough and happy moments in her life that made her appreciate the importance of leading a healthy lifestyle. Alec was very happy for her and showed his unconditional support and admiration for her as soon as the book came out.</p><p>"<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I need to warn you. You are going to read this book and fall in love with this woman</a>," he joked, according to Vanity Fair. "I’m completely serious. So read the book, but don’t fall in love with her. Because you can’t have her. Because she is my wife.
