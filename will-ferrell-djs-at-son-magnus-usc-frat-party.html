In the <a href=# rel=noopener>viral social media video</a> — which was taken during the university’s family weekend — Will put on a pair of headphones and played <strong>Survivor</strong>’s “Eye of the Tiger” at the DJ booth, clapping his hands above his head while he fiddled with the soundboard’s controls. Later, he used a fog cannon to blow smoke into the crowd.</p><p>Before USC <a href=#>won in overtime</a> to the Arizona Wildcats, students partied with Will — who rocked a zip-up hoodie and a backwards hat emblazoned with the USC logo — by singing along to the song, clapping with him and dancing. The<a href=#> Saturday Night Live alum</a>, for his part, graduated from USC in 1990.</p><p>Fans praised Will for being the “coolest dad ever” in the TikTok video’s comments. “What a legend,” one user wrote, while another added: “Absolutely epic!”</p><p>Will who shares Magnus — as well as sons Mattias, 16, and Axel, 13 — with wife <strong>Viveca Paulin</strong>, has frequently supported<a href=#> his eldest child</a> in various outlandish ways over the years.</p><p>In December 2022, Magnus publicly performed with his band for the first time at the Cancer for College benefit. At the end of the set, Will — whose USC frat brother founded the organization — hopped on stage <a href=#>with his son</a> and played his famous <a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a> cowbell.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Will-Ferrell-Dj-Sons-Frat-College.jpg><p>Will has been open about fatherhood through the years. In a December 2015 interview with <a href=#>Australia’s News.com</a>, he explained how he could relate to the familial message of his comedy Daddy’s Home.</p><p>“We’re all flying blind a little bit as parents, we’re just trying and hoping that we’re doing the right thing,” he said. “We don’t really know but as long as there’s <a href=#>enough love in a family</a>, it’ll cushion any bumpy landing. I can definitely identify with that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued to gush over his role as a dad, telling the outlet that after the interview was over he was headed to “meet my wife at a field and help coach our 8-year-old’s soccer team,” he told the publication. “I love doing that kind of stuff ’cause I was fairly sporty myself growing up.”</p><p>Recently, the whole Ferrell family hit the red carpet at the July <a href=#>premiere of Barbie</a> in London. Will and his three sons dressed in dapper suits for the occasion, while Paulin, 54, looked timeless in a blue gown.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGawoZyheqex0aucpaRdmbe0ecCtZKynnmK6orPNrqpmraOYeqe%2BwK1kqZmiqcZw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
