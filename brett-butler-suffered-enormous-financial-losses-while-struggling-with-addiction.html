Unlike <a href=#>Steven Tyler, who still has a $150 million fortune</a>, Butler's <strong>severe addiction</strong> took a toll not only on her well-being but also on her financial stability.</p><p>Butler's story was similar to <a href=#>Bradley Cooper's, wasting a fortune on his addictions before getting sober</a>, and <a href=#>Kelsey Grammer's addiction that caused drama on the set of Frasier</a>. After a series of personal struggles, Butler was forced to rely on <strong>crowdfunding </strong>just to afford her cost of living.</p><h2 id=how-did-brett-butler-lose-her-net-worth-and-become-broke>How Did Brett Butler Lose Her Net Worth And Become Broke?</h2><p>Brett Butler was earning $250,000 per episode as the star of the ABC sitcom Grace Under Fire. At the peak of her career in the mid-1990s, she amassed around a $25 million net worth from the show, but she lost it all due to what she describes as profligate spending and financial carelessness.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/th-image-template-21.jpg><p>Butler told The Hollywood Reporter:</p><p>"I was a little bit too trusting with some people that worked for me, and I had a lot of things stolen. That's just stupid on my part, not to have insurance for those things. And to loan and give a lot of money away. I really just felt so guilty for having it — I almost couldn't get rid of it fast enough."</p><p>Butler initially relied on a promised Grace Under Fire DVD deal worth $1 million, but the deal never materialized. She hoped for a comeback, but Butler's sporadic TV appearances yielded significantly less income than her Grace Under Fire days. She only earned the minimum salary for Hollywood, around $5,000 for a one-day shoot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th colspan=2 scope=col><p>Brett Butler's Personal Information via People</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Full Name</strong></p></td><td><p>Brett Anderson</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Birthdate</strong></p></td><td><p>January 30, 1958</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Birthplace</strong></p></td><td><p>Montgomery, Alabama US</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=2><p><strong>Parents</strong></p></td><td><p>Roland Decatur Anderson Jr.</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Carol</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><strong>Number of Siblings</strong></p></td><td><p>4</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=1 rowspan=2><p><strong>Previous Marriages</strong></p></td><td><p>Charles Michael Wilson (1978 - 1981)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Ken Zieger (1987 - 1999)</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>According to MovieWeb, in July 2021, Brett Butler and her friend, Lon Strickler, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">created a GoFundMe account to prevent Butler from being evicted</a> from her Los Angeles apartment. Butler initially hesitated, but after Strickler convinced her, they set the fundraising goal at $15,000.

Her entertainment career continued with the pressures of starring in Chuck Lorre's ABC sitcom Grace Under Fire, a series based on her own life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/th-image-template-19.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Butler admitted to The Hollywood Reporter that she got <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">addicted to Vicodin after it was prescribed to her for sciatica treatment</a>. This led to Butler's erratic behavior on set, causing co-star departures, the show's abrupt cancelation in its fifth season, and significant financial losses for the producers.</p><p>"At the bloody bitter end, I really was difficult. I was out of my mind. Drugs will do that to you. The show should have been pulled sooner than it was."</p><p>Butler initially managed to keep her addiction under control, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">clashes with the show's producers tainted her credibility.</a> Butler acknowledged her difficulties and the toll of drug abuse on her professionalism and its cancelation was seen as a necessary intervention. Butler told TV Guide:</p><p>"Well yeah, after eight Vicodin and a coffee at a table read. It was just getting ridiculous... It's a rarefied playing field to have your own show and everything you need. There's just something inside of me that could not get filled up on this alone."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brett-butler-39-s-substance-addiction-cost-her-career>Brett Butler's Substance Addiction Cost Her Career</h2><p>As Grace Under Fire entered its fourth season, Brett Butler's escalating addiction coincided with a decline in ratings. Butler's struggles led to her first stint in rehab, delaying the fifth-season premiere to November 1997. After <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Butler's multiple relapses and missed tapings</a>, ABC decided to cancel the show, but Butler still managed to earn Golden Globe nominations for her performance in the sitcom.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/th-image-template-22.jpg><p>The cancelation of Grace Under Fire made <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Butler clean up her addiction to painkillers in over six months</a>. Butler took responsibility for her role in the show's downfall. She achieved sobriety in July 1998 and has remained drug and alcohol-free since. Butler told THR:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'll definitely take the hit for the crash and burn...
