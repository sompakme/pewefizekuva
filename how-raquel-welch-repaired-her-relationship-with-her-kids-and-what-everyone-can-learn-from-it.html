That said, some people who are dealing with tensions in their biological family could make peace.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Is Sam Asghari Making Britney Spears' Family Feud Worse?</a></span>Of course, some <a href=#>families that seem broken</a> from the outside looking in simply are going through a tough time and eventually will be able to move on naturally. However, in a lot of cases where something has gone wrong in a family, somebody needs to step up and make the effort to mend their relationships.In the past, the Hollywood legend Raquel Welch revealed that after a lot of rough years, she managed to repair her relationship with her kids. After learning about how Welch accomplished that feat, it quickly becomes clear that everyone could learn from her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-raquel-welch-rsquo-s-relationship-with-her-kids-was-so-strained>Why Raquel Welch’s Relationship With Her Kids Was So Strained</h2><p>At the height of Raquel Welch’s acting career, she was one of the most in-demand actors in Hollywood by far. Wanting to cash in on her stardom, Welch often found herself working on films that required her to be far away from her kids and that caused tension in her family.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Don't Want To Have Kids (And Why?)</a></span></p><p>When Raquel Welch spoke to Oprah in the past, she spoke about how traveling the world to work on films and attend red carpet events <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">affected her relationship with her kids</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"When I'm running around the world and being Miss Sex Symbol and having this big career in film and everything and I'm running from place to place, I couldn't always be with my children when I wanted to be. Eventually, I could see that this was taking its toll on my kids, and it used to just break my heart."</p><p>While Raquel Welch’s busy schedule caused a real rift to form in her relationships with her son and daughter, it turns out that people also made up reasons for there to be tension in her family.</p><p>When Raquel Welch’s son Damon got married in 1981, she appeared at the nuptials in a black dress that some attendees deemed too revealing. As a result, there were stories in the press that Welch’s son and the woman he married that day were mad at Raquel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amazingly enough, Raquel Welch’s former daughter-in-law Rebecca Ferrene came forward <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">to set the record straight</a> in 2020.</p><p>“Everyone gets upset about the fact she wore a black dress that showed her cleavage, but the fact is that she wore a beautiful embroidered jacket over the dress to come in the church.”</p><p>“She was trying to respect English tradition and tried to wear an English dress and jacket ensemble. I actually thought she looked very stylish and beautiful on the day.”</p><p>While other people at Raquel Welch’s son’s wedding may have gossiped about her dress, it seems clear that reports of her outraging her son and daughter-in-law were overblown. Still, what Welch revealed to Oprah makes it clear that she had a difficult relationship with her kids in the past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-raquel-welch-bonded-with-her-kids>How Raquel Welch Bonded With Her Kids</h2><p>Unfortunately, it isn’t uncommon for stars to have <a href=#>estranged relationships with their kids</a>. With that in mind, it may seem like Raquel Welch’s once strained relationship with her kids shouldn’t be noteworthy. After all, Welch isn’t the only <a href=#>star who was able to med fences with their kids</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Have Written Parenting Books</a></span></p><p>The reason that Raquel Welch making peace with her kids is so worth talking about is simple, everyone should follow in her footsteps even if things are fine in their family. During the aforementioned Oprah interview, Welch explained <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how she made things right with her kids</a>.</p><p>"I just started out realizing that I really needed to swim out to the wave. I needed to take a lot more initiative and just keep letting them know that I wanted to be there in their lives with them, that I had something I could offer to them."</p><p>"Little by little, the disappointment or the lack of confidence they had in me melted away."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, if you have a toxic relationship with someone you care about, continuously putting yourself out there to be hurt again and again is a bad idea. However, there are a lot of people who let their ego and pride make them demand that whoever they are arguing with make the first move to mend things.</p><p>If more people were willing to take the first step toward an estranged loved one, there would be a lot more happiness in the world. Just like Raquel Welch, those same people would then have to follow up that initial step towards making things right by continuing to be there for their estranged loved one.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even if a person gets along with their family fine, following in Raquel Welch’s footsteps also seems like a great idea.
