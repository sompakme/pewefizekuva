In 2013, Star Magazine (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">via Nicki Swift</a>) reported that in the photo booth pictures, "Will appears shirtless and Margo[t] lifts her shirt up to reveal her lingerie."</p><p>A source added that "once they pulled the curtain back to take the pictures, they let their inhibitions run wild, laughing, hugging and muzzling each other in the dark." E! News quickly clarified that the "pictures were commissioned by production," per a trusted informant.</p><p>"The entire cast and crew saw them taken," they said. "The photo booth was on set all day for a bit of fun. It wasn't even a party—they were taken during the day and everyone knew about them. It was the last day of shooting." They added that "Will and Margot are absolutely just friends, that is all."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Robbie was linked to Skarsgård multiple times while promoting their movie together. One time, they were spotted kissing during the Sundance Film Festival party. "They were there late-night holding hands," claimed an insider (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">via PinkVilla</a>). "Margot and Alexander definitely looked like a couple. They were very touchy-feely and, at one point, were full-on kissing!"</p><p>They also walked the red carpet together before that. Neither of the actors confirmed the rumors. Later, in <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">an interview with Entertainment Weekly</a>, director David Yates revealed that Robbie slapped Skarsgård during their love scene.</p><p>"They're doing this love scene together, and I said [to Robbie], 'Just slap Alex while you're making love, just kind of give him a punch,'" said the filmmaker. "It was sort of an earthy, sensual moment of her enjoying sex with Alex, and the only bruise he picked up during the entire shoot was probably that punch from Margot. Which says a lot about her feistiness."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Margot Robbie Still Refused The Request Of A Foot-Double After 8-Takes For A Scene In Barbie</a></span></p><h2 id=why-did-margot-robbie-refuse-to-date-actors>Why Did Margot Robbie Refuse To Date Actors?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/copy-of-untitled.jpg><p>In her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">March 2015 cover with Marie Claire</a>, Robbie discussed why she didn't want to date actors. First, she said, "I am officially off the market," referring to <a href=# rel=nofollow>her future husband, Tom Ackerley</a>. "I made a conscious decision not to date actors, but not because I hate actors. That's a nasty generalization to make, and that's not the case."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She then explained that "People take such an interest in your love life when you have a profile that it puts a lot of stress on a relationship. So, two people with profiles, I figure it's just double the amount of scrutiny, and I'd like to avoid that at all costs." The cover came out, a month after she was allegedly spotted kissing Skarsgård.</p><p>Speaking about her personal life, Robbie said that she still lives a "normal" one. "I have a normal 24-year-old life," she said back then. "If I were a waitress, I'd probably have the exact same lifestyle. I'd go to the same clubs I go to already, live in the same house with the same housemates, hang out with the same people."</p><p>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>Babylon actress</a> went on to admit that being an actress "has made me start questioning people's motives," adding that "I have never been a cynical person. I'd rather trust nine people and have the tenth one stab me in the back. I'd take that fall in order to have those nine friendships or working relationships instead of having none. That's not living."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Michael Strahan Used A Banned Word He Shouldn't Have Used During His Interview With Margot Robbie, And It Made For An Awkward Moment</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-margot-robbie-39-s-husband>Who Is Margot Robbie's Husband?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/margot-robbie-husband-tom-ackerley.jpg><p>Robbie and Ackerley tied the knot in December 2016 in Australia. They first met on the set of Suite Française where he was working as the third assistant director. In 2014, they moved in together with several other roommates.</p><p>"We kept it a secret. Because we weren't really taking it seriously. 'Oh, whatever, we're just mates, we're just mates.' And then… everyone found out," the Bombshell star told the Guardian in 2018 (<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">via Insider</a>). "Our house turned into The Jerry Springer Show for a moment there.
