There have been a number of wrestlers over the past few decades who have been able to live lavishly because of the&nbsp;hefty salaries they receive from WWE.</p><p>Each year, there is a new report released by Forbes that names the top ten highest-paid athletes&nbsp;of the past year.&nbsp;There are a number of big names on the list this year,&nbsp;including athletes like John Cena, The Rock, and Brock Lesnar, but the list also includes some WWE stars that signed very good contracts to ensure that they&nbsp;could continue to live their comfortable lifestyles.</p><p>Mansions and luxury cars&nbsp;are some things that come hand in hand with the wrestling business. Many WWE stars have a number of luxury cars that they are able to park comfortably in the huge garages that come with their spacious homes. Not all wrestlers can afford to live this way but there&nbsp;are a number of them who have been sensible enough with their&nbsp;income. The following list looks at just 15 of the highest paid athletes who live the lives of the rich and famous because of the money that&nbsp;they have made wrestling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-undertaker-s-net-worth-is-estimated-at-16-million>The Undertaker's Net Worth Is Estimated At $16 Million</h2><p><a href=#>The Undertaker</a>&nbsp;has been a part of WWE&nbsp;for the past three decades.&nbsp;His income has been fairly level over the past few years, which has ensured that he and his wife, Michelle McCool, have been able to live&nbsp;the high life in their mansion in Texas.</p><p>The Undertaker also owns a number of other properties in the United States, which includes a ranch in Cedar Creek, Texas&nbsp;with a wrestling ring and an indoor gym. The Undertaker has never kept it a secret that he is a huge fan of bikes and, at one point, was even able to incorporate it into his WWE character. As a result, he actually owns a number of bikes and cars, including a 1987 Mercedes-Benz. It seems that working with WWE once a year is working out well for The Deadman, whose net worth is still an estimated $16 million.</p><h2 id=rey-mysterio-collects-cars-and-motorcycles>Rey Mysterio Collects Cars And Motorcycles</h2><p><a href=#>Rey Mysterio</a> hasn't appeared on WWE for a number of years but he did recently return for a one-off appearance as part of The Royal Rumble back in January. The fact that Mysterio&nbsp;has been one of the most popular stars in the company over the past few decades has allowed him to purchase some incredible things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mysterio owns a comfortable home in&nbsp;Chula Vista, California and is quite a fan of cars and motorcycles as well. Much like Undertaker, Mysterio loves bikes but also has a number of cars including a BMW and a Mercedes-Benz. With a net worth of around $8.5 million and the rumor that Rey could be returning to WWE soon, his income&nbsp;will likely only be growing in the coming months.</p><h2 id=vince-mcmahon-s-net-worth-is-estimated-as-somewhere-in-the-billions>Vince McMahon's Net Worth Is Estimated As Somewhere In The Billions</h2><p>The Chairman of WWE had to make it to the list, considering the fact that he owns a huge property in Greenwich, Connecticut&nbsp;that features&nbsp;a huge garden, outdoor swimming pool, a conservatory area, and a huge driveway that is used to store Vince's car collection.&nbsp;<a href=#>Vince McMahon</a>&nbsp;also lives right down the road from his daughter, Stephanie, her husband, Triple H, and their three daughters.</p><p>Speaking of cars, Vince currently owns a $200,000 Bentley Continental GT from 2010 and a number of other impressive rides that he can obviously afford since his current net worth is estimated to be in the billions. McMahon is thought to be heading towards his retirement in the coming years, which means that he would definitely be able to live comfortably in retirement if his house and car collection are anything to go by.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=goldberg-is-a-committed-car-collector>Goldberg Is A Committed Car Collector</h2><p><a href=#>Bill Goldberg</a> will always be seen as the undefeated WCW legend but he recently returned to WWE back in 2016 to be part of a fight with Brock Lesnar, becoming the Universal Champion for the first time.</p><p>Even though Goldberg hadn't stepped foot in a WWE ring for more than a decade, the income he has brought in over the past few years has enabled him to purchase an incredible home on the west coast. The home boasts an outdoor swimming pool as well as 18 acres of land that the star can make use of. As well as his impressive house, Goldberg also has quite the car collection, which includes a&nbsp;2011 Ford F-250 Super Duty, 1970 Boss 429 Mustang,&nbsp;1965 Shelby Cobra Replica,&nbsp;1966 Jaguar XK-E Series 1 Convertible, and a 1969 Dodge Charger.</p><h2 id=the-miz-s-car-collection-is-extremely-expensive>The Miz's Car Collection Is Extremely Expensive</h2><p><a href=#>The Miz</a>'s home has been featured&nbsp;on the reality show,&nbsp;Total Divas,&nbsp;over the past few years and it puts many stars' homes to shame. Miz and Maryse called their home "Chateau MarMiz" but they recently announced they were expecting their first child together and has sold their old home to move into a castle. They clearly are living a life of luxury and will make sure their child gets the best of everything.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as having a home that many stars are jealous of, Miz has an expensive car collection. Miz owns a&nbsp;2017 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited,&nbsp;Mercedes-Benz S550, and a 2013 Audi R8. While his professional career continues to skyrocket with the announcement of his new series, Miz's life is definitely becoming one to be envious of.</p><h2 id=cm-punk-lives-in-a-fancy-2-5-million-home-in-chicago>CM Punk Lives In A Fancy $2.5 Million Home In Chicago</h2><p>The former WWE superstar hasn't stepped into a wrestling ring&nbsp;in more than four years but his next&nbsp;UFC fight could be taking place in the near future, which means that he certainly won't have a cashflow problem.</p><p>From the outside,&nbsp;<a href=#>CM Punk'</a>s $2.5 million apartment in Chicago doesn't look like much but it&nbsp;has a rooftop sitting room, a number of bedrooms, and even a tree theme throughout. Punk is also known to be quite the collector of cars and is reported to keep a number of these at his Chicago home but also keeps some at the house he owns in Wisconsin. He and his wife, former WWE Divas Champion <a href=#>AJ Lee</a>, split their time between the two locations. His wife is now a New York Times&nbsp;bestselling author so she also has an income of her own since leaving the wrestling business. Between AJ and Punk, their net worth is believed to be around $15 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-jericho-has-an-audi-and-a-lamborghini>Chris Jericho Has An Audi And A Lamborghini</h2><p><a href=#>Chris Jericho</a> has been one of the main stars in WWE over the past few years and he seems to get better and better with age. Jericho's most recent match against Kenny Omega confirmed this. As a result of maintaining a wrestling career, as well a successful singing&nbsp;with his band Fozzy, he has definitely earned enough money&nbsp;over the past few years to live a comfortable lifestyle with his small family.</p><p>Jericho owns an impressive home in&nbsp;Odessa, Florida, which he lives in with his wife and children. His home also boasts quite a large garage that stores around five cars. Jericho is reported to have both an Audi and a Lamborghini in his possession. Given his $18 million net worth, there could be a number of cars added to this collection in the future.</p><h2 id=randy-orton-has-an-impressive-car-collection>Randy Orton Has An Impressive Car Collection</h2><p>Much like <a href=#>John Cena</a>, <a href=#>Randy Orton</a> has been able to remain a top star in WWE over the past decade, which has meant that he has been able to live&nbsp;a luxurious lifestyle. Orton currently owns an incredible mansion in&nbsp;St. Charles, Missouri, which is his third mansion. He sold his previous homes, the latest one&nbsp;was sold after his divorce from his first wife back in 2013.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As well as an impressive mansion, Orton is another star who prides himself on his car collection. His most prized possession&nbsp;is&nbsp;his Hummer 2 Dub, which was gifted to him by The Legacy when the trio was still together in WWE. Despite his divorce costing him a lot of money a few years ago, it seems that Orton has been able to find his feet once again with his new wife and two daughters.</p><h2 id=stephanie-mcmahon-and-triple-h-live-in-a-huge-mansion>Stephanie McMahon And Triple H Live In A Huge Mansion</h2><p><a href=#>Stephanie McMahon</a> and <a href=#>Triple H</a>&nbsp;are slowly beginning to inherit the family business and unlike many stars in the company right now, they won't be able to retire after a few years in the ring. The&nbsp;two&nbsp;have been part of the day-to-day business operations as well as serving as in-ring characters and performers over the past few years, which is why they are able to live such a luxurious lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Triple H and Stephanie's mansion is just down the road from her father <a href=#>Vince</a>'s property. It boasts an outdoor swimming pool, indoor gym, and even a sauna. It is also reported that their home consists of six different bedrooms, which is plenty of space for their three daughters and leaves room for more if they are planning on any future additions to the family. As well as his impressive house, Triple H also owns a number of cars, including a&nbsp;Cadillac Escalade, a BMW 7 Series 760LI, and a Mercedes Benz SL - Class.</p><h2 id=the-big-show-lives-in-a-multi-million-dollar-home-in-miami>The Big Show Lives In A Multi-Million Dollar Home In Miami</h2><p><a href=#>The Big Show</a>&nbsp;hasn't been seen in WWE since he was beaten in a steel cage match by Braun Strowman last year. The future WWE Hall of Famer has been a dominant giant in the company&nbsp;for the past decade and thanks to that, he has been able to afford to live&nbsp;extravagantly.</p><p>Big Show purchased a multi-million dollar home in Miami, Florida back in 2007 after buying a property from fellow WWE star, <a href=#>The Undertaker</a>, a few years earlier in 2001&nbsp;with its own boating dock and swimming pool. Big Show hasn't retired from WWE just yet but rumors suggest that he could be planning on it in the coming months. With an estimated net worth of around $20 million, it seems that he will be&nbsp;enjoying a comfortable retirement in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=batista-has-already-amassed-a-net-worth-of-around-18-million>Batista Has Already Amassed A Net Worth Of Around $18 Million</h2><p><a href=#>Batista</a> is a former World Champion in WWE but he decided to walk away from the company for a second time back in 2014 and has since been able to successfully make the switch over to a career in Hollywood. Batista has quite an impressive mansion in Lutz, Florida, which has also become the place where he stores his expensive car collection.</p><p>Batista owns a&nbsp;Mercedes-Benz SL500,&nbsp;a 2003 BMW, and a number of superbikes, which he loves to show off whenever possible. It seems that with his success in movies, Batista has been able to continue to buy more cars to add to his collection. There are rumors that Batista is set to return to WWE in the near future, which would only add to his already remarkable net worth of $18 million.</p><h2 id=john-cena-avidly-collects-classic-cars>John Cena Avidly Collects Classic Cars</h2><p>Any wrestling fan who watches Total Divas will know that&nbsp;<a href=#>John Cena</a> has quite an impressive home. His mansion includes an outdoor swimming pool, its own guest house, and a private boating dock. Cena's success has allowed him to live quite comfortably over the past few years, which includes paying for his obsession with classic cars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cena currently owns more cars than he has wrestling world titles, with his full collection including a 1966 Dodge Hemi Charger, 1969 COPO Chevrolet Camaro, 1969 Dodge Daytona, 1970 AMC Rebel Machine, 1970 Buick GSX, 2007 Dodge Charger SRT-8, 1969 AMC AMX, 1970 Mercury Cougar Eliminator, 1970 Oldsmobile Cutlass Rallye 350, 1970 Plymouth Superbird, 2006 Ford GT, 1970 Pontiac GT Judge, 1971 Plymouth Road Runner, 2006 Dodge Viper, 2007 Ford Mustang Saleen Parnelli Jones, and a 2009 Chevrolet Corvette ZR1. It seems that Cena really is an avid car collector.</p><h2 id=the-rock-has-a-net-worth-of-around-190-million>The Rock Has A Net Worth Of Around $190 Million</h2><p><a href=#>The Rock</a> is the wealthiest former wrestler in the world. Having done his time in the squared circle, the Samoan star picked the perfect time to switch careers and has since been making a name for himself in some of the most popular films and television shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Rock has a net worth of around $190 million. He owns a $3.4 million mansion in Florida which is part of a gated estate that features 6-bedrooms, 7-baths, a home theatre, gym, swimming pool, and expansive grounds. As well as his incredible home, The Rock&nbsp; has an impressive car collection that includes a Ford Black Gorilla, a white Ferrari, A Rolls-Royce Wraith, a Pagani Huayra worth more than a million dollars, a Mclaren 650s, and a&nbsp;1971 Chevrolet SS, which was featured in the movie, Fast and Furious 7.</p><h2 id=brock-lesnar-is-the-highest-paid-wrestler-in-wwe-right-now>Brock Lesnar Is The Highest Paid Wrestler In WWE Right Now</h2><p><a href=#>Brock Lesnar</a> is the highest paid wrestler in WWE right now after earning a reported $12 million for his role in the company over the past year, despite only making a handful of appearances. It is well-known that Brock owns his own private jet because he doesn't like WWE's touring schedule or being around people, which is why he lives in the middle of nowhere.</p><p>Brock isn't like most superstars, he is a guy who loves his own space away from civilization and is known to be an avid fan of hunting. His house is completely surrounded by a forest and&nbsp;is reportedly so far out in the middle of nowhere that he has to go to his local post office on a regular basis to pick up his mail because no one is even aware that he and his family are there. He does have a hot tub outside the house and free-range of the forest, which is perhaps why he loves the fact that he's in a secluded area.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kofi-kingston-has-an-entire-arcade-in-his-house>Kofi Kingston Has An Entire Arcade In His House</h2><p>Kofi Kingston is one of the most decorated tag team wrestlers in WWE history. Being a focal part of WWE TV for the past decade has allowed Kofi to create a comfortable life for himself outside of the company.</p><p>Kofi's home is in Florida and it has been featured on WWE because of the fact that he has an entire arcade in his house, which he calls the "Boom Room." It's also the place where he keeps his collection of wrestling merchandise. Kofi is a family man. He shares three children with his wife, which could be why he spends so much of his money collecting merchandise rather than following in the footsteps of fellow WWE stars with car or superbike collections.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmnJmiqHyktNGiqmailae2pLTOZqawpqNirm64wKaZqKqXnbavtYyapZ1lYWl6sMDHnqlmoJmctaa%2F02anmqGUYsSzsdKto56qo2LEqbuMqK6nZZ2Wu7S1zqeqZpmemXqtwdeuqbJlk5a%2FtHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
