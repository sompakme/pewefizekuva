I noticed this. When he was with the Black people, he would kind of tone up how Black&nbsp;he&nbsp;was acting,” he said.&nbsp;“When he knew he was safe when he knew it was a judgment-free zone, and he could be himself, that’s when he realized his mom was a professor.&nbsp;And he&nbsp;didn’t come from Chicago,&nbsp;he came from Hyde Park.&nbsp;Big&nbsp;difference.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“He came from the campus of&nbsp;[the] University&nbsp;of Chicago.
