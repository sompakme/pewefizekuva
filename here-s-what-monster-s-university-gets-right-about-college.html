From Wall-E, to Up, and everything in between, they push the limits of what is possible in the <a href=#>realm of animation</a>, their films always prove to be visually stunning, and they&nbsp;know how to captivate audiences with their stellar storytelling. While many of their&nbsp;movies are set in unrealistic scenarios, there is one film that is perhaps more realistic than the rest…even if the main characters are, well, monsters. Monsters University is the prequel to the blockbuster:&nbsp;In Monsters Inc, viewers learn about <a href=#>Mike and Sulley</a>, who are two workers at Monsters Incorporated, witnessing their interactions with a human child who has entered the monster world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While a sequel would be nice to tie up loose ends, Disney decided to create a prequel, Monsters University, which&nbsp;documents the relationship of Mike and Sulley when they were&nbsp;in college, as they turned from bitter enemies to best friends. The film emphasizes the importance of diversity, and celebrates what makes the monsters different from one another, and what makes their abilities&nbsp;and talents special.</p><p>The film fosters inclusion for all,&nbsp;the college is open to all monsters who want to become "scarers". Sulley is a true jock, and comes from a family of successful monsters, so in some ways, his future is already written for him.&nbsp;Consequently, he doesn’t really bother to try hard in class. Mike, on the other hand, is anything but scary; he is a cute one-eyed creature who is funny, sarcastic and loveable. He has to work extremely hard to prove that he is meant to be in the scaring program and deserves to be given an opportunity to showcase his talents.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/monsters_university1_1_1020.jpg><p>It might feel strange that Mike and Sulley become friends, because they are vastly different, but that is the&nbsp;case with many college relationships. Kids come from all walks of life, and are put in positions where they are required to interact with individuals from a different background, with a&nbsp;varied&nbsp;set of talents.</p><p>When students encounter roommates for the first time, they are obviously without parental supervision, and have true reign over their lives. We see Mike, a stellar student, studying hard and cramming for exams. On the other hand, we witness Sulley sleeping through lectures and not being prepared for tests&nbsp;or presentations.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hard work and determination are big themes in this movie, as well as&nbsp;the importance of diversity amongst students, which proves beneficial in shaping worldviews and impacting the way we perceive ourselves and others. Intellectual collaboration and diversity amongst students&nbsp;prove key to their success.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The 5 Most Overrated Pixar Films (And 10 You Need To Watch At Least Once</a></span></p><p>In the film, Sulley initially is recruited to the popular fraternity, while Mike gravitates towards the more crafty, “nerdy” fraternity. Mike is made the leader of Oozma Kappa, and when the organization needs one more monster in order for them to be able to participate in the annual Scare Games, Sulley begrudgingly joins. The games&nbsp;begin, and the relationship and dynamic between Sulley and Mike are&nbsp;tested, and they learn to work together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yes, Mike is adorable and Sulley is scary, but what matters is that they are both monsters…they both have the ability to scare, even if it is in differing ways than the other.&nbsp;Even when the main characters are removed&nbsp;from the scare program, failing to&nbsp;get re-enrolled, they&nbsp;realize the importance of embracing their differences. Sulley and Mike&nbsp;eventually become inseparable, and begin their journey as mail room attendants at Monsters Incorporated. They can start at the bottom, and one day work their way up to the scare floor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/maxresdefault-9.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This film is funny, relatable, but not exactly scary,&nbsp;but comical, since the film is about monsters. It is interesting that Disney decided to produce this film as a prequel, when their film, Monsters Incorporated shows Mike and Sulley's experience working on the scare floor, ending with unanswered questions… like what happens to Boo (the little girl who stumbles into the monster world, but who they ultimately grow attached to). It will be interesting to see whether another film is on the horizon.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>14 Behind The Scenes Details Most Pixar Fans Didn't Know</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKannqjBpr7SZqynoaaav7S107JkoJ2kqHqztcahq2aZkqTCtXnCqKOlnZeafA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
