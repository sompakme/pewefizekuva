In 2012, the boys were inducted by legendary rappers Chuck D and LL Cool J to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame</a>, becoming the third rap group to achieve such a milestone. Since its disbandment, some members have passed away, while others continue their creative outlets someplace else. To sum it up, here's what happened to Beastie Boys and a throwback of how successful they were.</p><h2 id=how-successful-were-the-beastie-boys><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>How Successful Were The Beastie Boys?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Originally started as an experimental hardcore punk band, Beastie Boys transitioned to hip-hop following the success of their comedic rap tune "Cooky Pu**" in 1983, and the rest is history. During its peak, the Boys were among the artists who were responsible for the birth of Def Jam Records.</p><p>Their debut album, Licensed to Ill, was a classic rock-rap of the 1980s, amassing a Diamond certification after moving over ten million copies worldwide. They're also known to have influenced some of the best emcees to ever touch the mic like <strong><a href=#>Eminem</a></strong>, LL Cool J, and more.</p><h2 id=the-beastie-boys-were-inducted-to-the-rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-in-2012><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>The Beastie Boys Were Inducted To The Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame In 2012</span></h2><p>As a testament to their legacy, rap legends Chuck D and LL Cool J inducted Ad-Rock and co into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012. As mentioned, they became the third rap group to achieve the award after Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five (2007) and Run-DMC (2009).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=beastie-boys-legacy-in-the-2020s><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Beastie Boys Legacy, In The 2020s</span></h2><p>Fast-forward to the 2020s, Jackass co-creator Spike Jonze brought their story to life for newer audiences in his Apple TV+'s Beastie Boys Story. Released on April 24th, the 120-minute live documentary film chronicles the ups and downs of the influential rap-rock group, complete with a few unseen footages of some of their most iconic on-stage performances.</p><h2 id=john-berry-passed-away-in-2016><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>John Berry Passed Away In 2016</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As Beastie Boys shifted into hip-hop, John Berry joined the new formation as a guitarist in 1981 until 1982. While his time with the band wasn't that long, Berry was often credited for giving the name "Beastie Boys." In a 2007 interview with Charlie Rose, MCA confirmed the story. After departing the group, Berry lived a quiet life away from spotlight until he passed away in May 2016.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Beastie Boys Are Releasing A New Documentary!</a></span></p><h2 id=mike-d-produced-for-several-artists><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Mike D Produced For Several Artists</span></h2><p>Before Beastie Boys, Michael "Mike D" Diamond was a part of a few bands in the hardcore punk scene of New York. Besides vocal, he also provided the drum for the band until its disbandment in 2012. Outside of that, he had helped produce for several top talents in music and his producing credits appear in Portugal the Man and English duo Slaves' albums.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I taped a reggae show in the ’80s, The Gil Bailey Show, and there was a commercial for Paul’s Boutique, the one that’s on the record.

"Maybe Kate would’ve eventually quit the band because we were starting to act like a bunch of f–kin’ creeps, but it was just s–ty the way it happened. And I am so sorry about it."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are The 10 Best-Selling Boy Bands Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=mca-died-in-2012-from-a-cancer><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>MCA Died In 2012 From A Cancer</span></h2><p>Another former member who's gone too soon, Adam "MCA" Yauch passed away in 2012 from parotid cancer right after Beastie Boys announced their split. He fought the illness for at least three years starting from his diagnosis in 2009. Throughout his lifetime, the late bass player was also an outspoken figure in entertainment who often devoted his time to supporting good causes and fighting prejudice, especially against Muslims and Arabs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Adam Yauch brought a lot of positivity into the world and I think<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> it's obvious to anyone how big of an influence the Beastie Boys were on me and so many others,</a>" Em told <a href=#>MTV News</a> ahead of Yauch's passing.

Other than that, he'd also ventured into acting. He has cameo appearances in a few films back in the 2010s, including in Ben Stiller's While We're Young and in Alex Ross Perry's Golden Exits.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Well, when you’re sixteen, you think you’re the coolest person in the world, and, at the same time, you’re thinking you’re the squarest person in the world.
