He then noted that, even when he was an executive in AEW, he never asked for pyro, but he got so much of it that it became a gag.</p><p>“Oh my gosh. I would have to say, you want to go with the latter, go with the greatest. At this point, I’m gonna be honest, I never asked anybody for pyro. Even in AEW when I was running things, I never asked anybody for pyro, and then it became like a running gag, the amount of pyro, and now it’s not even that, it’s just part of the experience.</p><p>“It’s like the fireworks at Magic Kingdom. You know, this happens at this time and they legit blow up the sky. I think with a WrestleMania on the west coast, in Hollywood, it’s the biggest display that’s ever been done involving a ring. I don’t think greatest can even cover it. I really don’t. I think you’re looking at a record setting amount of pyro.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>WrestleZone will have coverage of WWE WrestleMania 39 as it airs on April 1 and 2.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJuaXJsaGKwsLDYZqmhp5SawG7AxJqqnqtdnbKtuIyhmK%2BdXZZ6s7HCqKmdZaOawbW1zaBkmqWfqru1ec6fZKmxoqR6osCMsKmeq6Shsq6tzaKYZmtp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
