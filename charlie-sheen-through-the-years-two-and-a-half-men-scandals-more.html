Charlie did not make his own foray onto the big screen, however, until 10 years later when he had a small role in Red Dawn opposite Hollywood heavyweights such as <a href=#><strong>Patrick Swayze</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Lea Thompson</strong></a>. His first major part followed in 1986 with the war film Platoon.</p><p>Charlie continued to star in box office hits including Wall Street (with dad Martin) and Major League through the ‘80s and ‘90s and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1994. His biggest break, though, came in 2003 when he was cast as Charlie Harper in Two and a Half Men. He starred in the CBS sitcom alongside <a href=#><strong>Jon Cryer</strong></a> for eight seasons before <a href=#>being fired in 2011</a> for making derogatory comments about the show’s creator, <strong>Chuck Lorre</strong>. At the time, Charlie had been struggling with drug and alcohol abuse and gave a series of infamous interviews in which he ranted about “tiger blood” and boasted about “winning” in life.</p><p>After being <a href=#>roasted on Comedy Central</a> later in 2011, Charlie made his return to the small screen. He <a href=#>starred in the TV adaptation</a> of <a href=#><strong>Jack Nicholson</strong></a>’s movie Anger Management, which aired on FX from 2012 to 2014.</p><p>While Charlie’s career has slowed down in recent years, his personal life and relationships continue to make headlines. He was married to <strong>Donna Peele</strong> from 1995 to 1996, <a href=#><strong>Denise Richards</strong></a> from 2002 to 2006 and <a href=#><strong>Brooke Mueller</strong></a> from 2008 to 2011. He has five children: Cassandra with high school sweetheart <strong>Paula Profit</strong>, Sam and Lola with Richards and twins Bob and Max with Mueller. He is <a href=#>also a grandfather</a> to Cassandra’s daughter, Luna.</p><p>In 2015, Charlie <a href=#>announced that he was HIV positive</a> and had been diagnosed approximately four years prior. While focusing on his health, he also <a href=#>gave up one of his past vices</a>, alcohol, in 2017.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I made some changes to give myself a shot to do some cool things professionally,” he exclusively told Us Weekly in 2019. “And I’m <a href=#>proud of finally being consistent</a>. And reliable. And noble.”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to see Charlie through the years!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksKmt0aWgnmWjnbKmuoytn6unpZy1bsDHnmSynZGnwG7A1qhkmqaUYq5utMClnWallaN6tK%2FAp5uapKNiurC%2BxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
