In fact, the undisputed super lightweight/light-middleweight champion rebranded his name from 'Pretty Boy' Floyd to Floyd 'Money' Mayweather in 2012, supposedly as a statement to let the world know that he has so much money that his very identity has become one with it. Floyd has been classified as the richest boxer in the entire world and can boast a net worth of a whopping $410 million. With that amount of money to your name (no pun intended), it's easy to see why Floyd's car collection is so extensive and optional. In June 2021, <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he literally made $100,000,000.00 for fighting famed youtube content creator Logan Paul.</a> Mayweather has managed to amass immense wealth in his life because of his superior skill in promoting and selling championships, and<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> he has a jaw-dropping car collection featuring 16 cars to prove it.</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=money-is-the-motivation>Money Is The Motivation</h2><p>Boxers don't get in the boxing ring and risk serious physical harm for pennies. Especially when you're a boxing sensation and fan favorite with your own boxing promotion firms (Mayweather Promotions and The Money Team) like Floyd, his resume as a professional boxing athlete is exceptional, being that he retired as an undisputed fighter with 50 fights under his belt, including exceptional wins <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">over Manny Pacquiao</a> and Canelo Alvarez. His boxing success is evident through his finances and the opulent lifestyle he maintains from flashy diamond-encrusted watches, an extensive shoe collection, private jets, and being able to boast <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the ownership of three luxurious mansions located in Las Vegas, Miami, and Los Angeles</a>; as well as his 16-car collection decked in his garage. Surely, if Floyd decided to switch careers and become a rapper, at least he won't have the hassle of spending an exorbitant amount of money on car rental bills. Who needs to rent when the wheels are yours? He's bought enough luxury cars of his own to begin an elite chauffeur service!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His most recent mansion purchase in Las Vegas, Nevada, is where Money Mayweather keeps his mini-car dealership collection. There should be no need to highlight that he rolls in pristine style, seeing he was willing to spend <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in excess of $40 million on sports car collection</a>. According to<a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> TMZ,</a> his car options include 5 Rolls Royce, 4 Ferraris, a Mercedez McLaren (the original), a Mercedez-Benz G63 (G-Wagon), an Aston Martin One-77, a Maybach s600, a Bently Mulsanne, a Lamborghini Murcielago, and a Lamborghini Aventador. Mind you; these are what Floyd considers his 'Sweet 16' car collection, meaning there are probably many other cars on the boxer's list of grandeur vehicles. Let's begin with the Rolls Royce to gain an idea of what price range boxing's 'Pretty Boy' is dealing with.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-rolls-royces>The Rolls Royces</h2><p>For starters, a Rolls-Royce Phantom costs about $400,000.00, but this is not the only edition he owns. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolls-Royce vehicles are synonymous with luxury</a>, class, and prestige, and all these characteristics are what Floyd seeks to embody. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Hot Cars</a>, in his possession are two Drophead Coupes priced at $520,000, a Phantom Limousine valued at $53,300, a Rolls-Royce Wraith worth $34,200, and a Phantom Limited Edition worth $641,000. To say the man loves Rolls Royce is an understatement!</p><h2 id=ferraris>Ferraris</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The only other sports car that can <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">compete with Floyd's love for the Rolls Royce is the Ferraris</a>. The first is the Ferrari Enzo. Priced at $3.2 million and with only 400 of these vehicles said to be manufactured in the world, Floyd made it his duty to be an owner of one. To add to its value, the production of the Ferrari Enzo was seized in 2004. It is believed that <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd bought the Enzo with the intent of reselling it a profit, which he did, for $4.8 million</a>. With a vehicle this rare, it's easy to see why he would make the investment.</p><p>Another high-priced gem in his garage is the Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. Production of manual transmission for this vehicle ended in 2012, making it more of a collector's item in recent years due to its rarity. The car has a top speed of 205 mph and can accelerate 0-62 mph in just 3.2 seconds. Its going price was $310,543, but that is only expected to increase.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Undoubtedly, the most expensive Ferrari owned by Mayweather is the limited-edition LaFerrari Apertas. There have only been 500 manufactured units of this supercar, with the last being sold at an auction for $10 million. The typical price before manufacturing was halted ranged between $2.1 million to $4.9 million.</p><p>RELATED<strong>:</strong><a href=#>Top 10 Nicest Cars in Floyd Mayweather's Collection</a></p><h2 id=aston-martin-one-77>Aston Martin One-77</h2><p>Also known as the James Bond car (because it was featured in the movie), the Aston Martin One-77 is an immaculate supercar specimen, with only 77 manufactured worldwide. Since Floyd's is a limited edition, it was estimated to run him around $3.4 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-lamborghinis>The Lamborghinis</h2><p>Quite a few celebrities own a Lamborghini or two, and Floyd happens to be one of them. He owns both the Lamborghini Aventador and the Lamborghini Murcielago, valued at $500,000 and $510,000, respectively. With a top speed of 212 mph and able to go from 0 to 62 in under 3 seconds, the Lamborgini Murcielago is one of the fastest supercars in the world right now. Floyd's need for speed made it certain that he picked up two of these bad boys.</p><p>His other vehicles, such as the Mercedez Benz G-63, the Maybach s600, and the Bently Mulsanne, all total $650,000. With that being the price of only three cars, it's easy to see how the summation of all his cars could total $40 million. One thing is for certain: this is a man who makes wise investments and has built his empire through multiple streams of income and not merely boxing. <a class=editor-rtfLink href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Similar to Michael Jordan after retiring from the NBA</a>, Money Mayweather is the epitome of success after pro-boxing retirement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT<strong>:&nbsp;</strong><a href=#>20 Cars In Floyd Mayweather's Garage That'll Make Conor McGregor Jealous</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sportskeeda</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HotCars,&nbsp;</a><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sun</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Essentially Sports</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTAuLHErWRqbl2eu7S1w55kn6SfrrFuucCyrp6ZpJ2ys7%2BMo5iwZZSnvLG8yKeeZpuRp3qku8ulnJysmaS7cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
