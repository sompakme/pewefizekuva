In 2010, she wrote her book "Oh My Dog: How to Choose, Train, Groom, Nurture, Feed, and Care for Your New Best Friend", reaching #5 on The New York Times Best Seller list. In 2014, Beth wrote her first children's book "Yoda: The Story of a Cat and his Kittens" and released its sequel book the following year titled "Yoda Gets a Buddy".</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Howard Stern Is Partially Responsible For Sarah Hyland's Career</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To take her love of animals to the next level, Beth decided to maintain dedicated foster rooms at her house for cats and kittens in need of permanent homes. She began this project in 2013 and followed it up by launching an Instagram account to gain more exposure for the animals for her care. For Beth, 2019 is a very memorable year considering that is when her account gained more than half a million followers. However, followers were not very happy with Beth's Instagram back in 2021 and think <a href=#>Howard Stern had changed her Instagram account</a>. Not only did Beth get more followers she also managed to get roughly 1,000 of the animals in her care adopted. Beth Stern is truly an admirable human being and has done a wonderful as an animal rights activist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-stern-and-beth-ostrosky-rsquo-s-happily-ever-after>Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky’s Happily Ever After</h2><p>After nearly a year of being engaged, Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky finally had their time to walk down the aisle. The wedding was surely one to remember with a celebrity-filled guest list that includes the Trump family, Jimmy Kimmel and, his then-girlfriend, Sarah Silverman, Chevy Chase, Joan Rivers, and Barbara Walters.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Are The Most Unlikable Howard Stern Show Staffers</a></span></p><p>The ceremony was officiated by none other than Mark Consuelos and Billy Joel was there to perform two beautiful songs at the ceremony. Everyone in attendance at Howard and Beth’s wedding did not realize it was happening that night because they kept it a secret. Guests thought they were invited to an engagment party but soon found out it was the real deal.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=howard-stern-and-beth-ostrosky-rsquo-s-are-stilling-going-strong>Howard Stern And Beth Ostrosky’s Are Stilling Going Strong</h2><p>It has been now 13 years since Howard Stern and Beth Ostrosky first said their “I do's” to one another, and they’re commitment to each other has remained stronger than ever. Howard and Beth have also gone so far as renewing their vows on The <a href=#>Ellen DeGenere</a>s Show in 2019 to prove their love to one another. Howard told Ellen that he would love to remarry his wife any and every day because he is just that happy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, the couple began working closely with the Wildlife Rescue Center of the Hamptons and the North Shore Animal League. Both Howard and Beth feel that helping animals find the homes and care they need is not only beneficial for the animals but to them as well because it always does feel good helping those who need it. Howard mentioned in an interview that “It’s just very fulfilling, it brings you outside yourself, you’re helping an animal and that bond, it sounds cliché, but that bond is really fantastic, and it makes me feel so good that we can help. Beth is so competent and so masterful with the animals coming through our home that it takes my breath away.” Another reason their relationship is going on still is because they are not afraid to be honest with each other. Beth Ostrosky was not hesitant to reveal to her husband when <a href=#>she was furious with how Howard Stern was treating his staff members</a>. It just proves that honesty is the best policy in any relationship and only makes it stronger.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Howard Stern Said Terrible Things About Ellen DeGeneres Before Becoming Her Friend</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK%2BRp7Fuv9Oeqadlp56zpnnBnquhZZ9iu6bAjLCmq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
