It’s not something you can explain to someone unless you’re going through it. That support system is needed where you can call the next wife [because] sometimes you just need someone to talk to and get your emotions out⎯not even just <a href=# id=auto-tag_basketball-wives_3 data-tag=basketball-wives>basketball wives</a> but with anything. When you have a friend or someone you can talk to that’s going through a similar situation it just makes things a lot easier.</span></p><p><span>Royce was the newest bond I made from the show, and I kind of knew Suzie before but I got to know her better. As far as Evelyn and I, we’ve been through so much over the past 10 years so it’s just another experience under our belt. Gloria has issues with a lot of the castmates like Royce, Suzie and obviously Shaunie because of the situation with her sister, so she is definitely the black sheep.</span></p><p><span>I just feel like [Gloria] is so into trying to portray that she has this perfect life. I think that was her whole purpose of being on the show, which⎯it’s whatever⎯but I just feel like she doesn’t really come across as being real. I don’t have a major beef with her. I don’t like some of her ways but if I see her again I’ll be cordial. When you get thrown into the show⎯this whole reality world⎯none of us know what to expect. But at the same time I think we were all really real and open to our situation, and I just feel like [Gloria] wasn’t 100% honest.</span></p><p><span>As far as some of the players, I don’t understand why they wouldn’t like the show. I guess they feel like we were putting them on blast but no one did that, we weren’t even talking about them. My thing is this, if you weren’t doing anything shady then you wouldn’t be worried about it.</span></p><p><span>I was definitely happy that Vh1 showed a different side of our lives. A lot of the episodes have been drama filled but we did do some good things too. Obviously drama is what gets ratings [but] I was happy they showed us going to the soup kitchen and my foundation too. That was important to see because the show wasn’t 100% about drama. It’s easy for people to judge but unless you’re in the situation, you can’t really relate to it or say what you’re going to do and that’s why a sisterhood for women who are going through a similar situation is important, but I hope everyone can get something positive out of it as well.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2Byr3nWoqOloZGiwG6uy6ieZpqRqLimwMGao6Vlp57Dpr%2BMrJ%2BorZyZerTAyJyiZqyfnLK1tMSrZG5qZ2mFcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
