In the world of beloved sitcom&nbsp;Friends, it's Phoebe Buffay.

They truly complement one another and like the theme song says, they're always there for each other. So it's really no wonder that viewers have thought up some theories about Phoebe.... and these are super intriguing.</p><p>Keep reading to find out 14 things that fans of&nbsp;Friends&nbsp;have come up with about popular character, Phoebe Buffay.</p><h2 id=phoebe-was-on-substances-the-entire-time><span class=item-num>14 </span><span>Phoebe Was On Substances The&nbsp;Entire Time</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Phoebe-Buffay-Friends.png><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME.com</a>, there is actually a theory that Phoebe was on substances the entire time.&nbsp;Marta Kauffman, the creator of Friends&nbsp;said, "That’s the saddest theory I’ve ever heard." And we would definitely have to agree with that. We can't imagine this being the case. It would be too strange.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=phoebe-is-homeless-spying-on-everyone-at-central-perk><span class=item-num>13 </span><span>Phoebe Is Homeless, Spying On Everyone At Central Perk</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Phoebe-Buffay-Playing-Guitar-Central-Perk-Friends.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Refinery29</a>&nbsp;says that another fan theory is that Phoebe is homeless, spying on everyone at Central Perk.</p><p>Sure, we get that this makes a little bit of sense, because she does hang out outside the cafe... but that's because she's playing music. We don't even want to think about a homeless Phoebe.</p><h2 id=phoebe-and-joey-were-sleeping-together-throughout-the-series><span class=item-num>12 </span><span>Phoebe And Joey Were Sleeping Together Throughout The Series</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Phoebe-Joey-Friends.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NME.com</a>&nbsp;says that there's a fan theory that Phoebe and Joey were sleeping together during the series. Matt LeBlanc actually&nbsp;mentioned this theory and was quoted as saying, "Towards the end we actually pitched the idea." The response was no. We're not sure how we feel about this one because they're such good friends.</p><h2 id=phoebe-is-an-alien-visiting-earth><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Phoebe Is An Alien Visiting Earth</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Phoebe-On-Friends.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lad Bible</a>&nbsp;says that another fan theory about Phoebe is that she's an alien.

She knew some weird people because of her twin, Ursula, and they might have wanted "revenge" on Phoebe.
