The rocker, 52, was spotted sipping on a cold Bud Light while attending a Colt Ford concert in Nashville on Thursday, August 17, according to photos obtained by TMZ. Rock looked relaxed as he drank the alcoholic refreshment and laughed with friends, who also enjoyed the blue-canned beer.
Rock went viral in April when he shared a video of himself shooting several cases of Bud Light in response to the brand rolling out a series of cans with pride colors to celebrate the LGBTQ+ community."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Let me say something to all you and be as clear and concise as possible,” Rock said in the Twitter clip before taking aim at the beverages with a firearm. He then turned back to the camera, stating, “ F—k Bud Light and f—k [brewing company] Anheuser-Busch.”</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Two days prior to Rock’s outburst, influencer<a href=#><strong> Dylan Mulvaney</strong>, who is transgender</a>, appeared in sponsored post for Bud Light as part of the company’s March Madness campaign. The ensuing backlash led to “more bullying and transphobia than I ever could’ve imagined,” she said in an Instagram video the following month.&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>Weeks after Mulvaney’s post — in which she promoted Bud Light’s contest to win $15,000 — Anheuser-Busch CEO<strong> Brendan Whitworth</strong> issued a statement saying the company “never intended to be a part of a discussion that divides people.”</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“As the CEO of a company founded in America’s heartland more than 165 years ago, I am responsible for ensuring every consumer feels proud of the beer we brew.

She also noted that “for a company to hire a trans person and then not publicly stand by them is worse, in my opinion, than not hiring a trans person at all.”</span><b></b></p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>“The hate doesn’t end with me,” she continued. “It has serious and grave consequences for the rest of our community.”&nbsp;</span><b></b></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr><span class=x_ContentPasted0>This <a href=#>wasn’t the first time Rock has sparked controversy</a> over his conservative beliefs.
