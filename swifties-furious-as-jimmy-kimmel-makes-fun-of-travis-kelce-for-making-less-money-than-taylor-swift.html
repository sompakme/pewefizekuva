And with good reason. Even though the host clearly had no ill intentions, it's usually considered bad manners to make fun of someone's profession or how much money they make.</p><p>While Travis Kelce is an incredibly successful NFL player and gets paid a huge amount of money every year, of course, compared to Taylor Swift, the most famous musician in the world right now and a literal billionaire, he makes significantly less.</p><p>He recently signed a contract for $34 million, and while Jimmy Kimmel congratulated him, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he quickly turned his latest achievement into a laughingstock</a>.</p><p>"Congratulations to Travis Kelce.

"It's more money than you make Jimmy" one user commented. Another pointed out "Can you imagine a career where people 'jokingly' insult another professional just because it’s the hot topic? Crazy."</p><p>A lot of commenters also said that, in this day and age, <strong>making fun of a man for making less than his girlfriend is old-fashioned and simply not funny</strong>, as it reinforces outdated gender roles.</p><h2 id=both-taylor-swift-and-travis-kelce-prioritize-their-careers>Both Taylor Swift And Travis Kelce Prioritize Their Careers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-at-coachella.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Regardless of how much money they make (and they both make a lot), what drives both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce is <a href=#>their passion for their careers</a>.
