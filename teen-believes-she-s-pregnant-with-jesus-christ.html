I’ve gained at least 22 pounds,” says Haley. “I was sleeping one night and my baby punched the bottom of my stomach and kicked me, and I can feel his head right here, right below my belly button.” She also told the host that Eminem was her biological father. “My mom has pictures of a guy that look just like Eminem, and I’m sitting on his lap,” she added.</p><p>The cringeworthy episode goes on to play with the teen’s delusions by performing an ultrasound on the show. The results read by Stork showed the teen wasn’t pregnant, but suffered from off balanced bowel movements. “The most notable thing on this ultrasound isn’t what we see; it’s what we don’t see,” he said. After a few back and forths between the host, the teen and her family, Dr. Phil got down to the root of Haley’s troubles. The teen was sexually molested, along with her sister when they were kids. She also faced difficulties of substance abuse and entered&nbsp;rehab for meth use. “I started getting the proper treatment that I needed, and I feel like if Haley could come to reality, and stop living in a fantasy world, and be honest with herself and others, I feel like she could be where I’m at,” he sister says.</p><p>“She kicked me out because my stepdad didn’t like me,” Haley said. “My mom always put her relationships before me. I encountered all kinds of bad things [being homeless]. It’s really scary when I was homeless because I had to do things in order to stay at a certain place. I had to do, like, sexual things.”</p><p>While her family was mum&nbsp;about her homeless journey, Phil promised to help the teen find help.</p><p>Check out a clip from the episode below.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6myprqMm5yloZWrsrR50qGcrGWgp7KousCnq2avmam1brbErKysZZOdv6q%2F02acsZuVpcFuv8eeqmamn6l6sb7EoKWapqRigXeAlmpwaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
