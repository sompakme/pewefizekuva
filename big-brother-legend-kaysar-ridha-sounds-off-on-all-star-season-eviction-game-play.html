Cody Calafiore,&nbsp;this summer's first&nbsp;Head of Household, was keen on nominating the both of them for eviction.</p><p>However, Kaysar won the "Safety Suite" competition and was able to protect himself and Janelle from eviction. But week three Head of Household Tyler Crispen finally broke up the duo by placing them on the block. Janelle was evicted by a 9-2 vote.</p><p>A week later, Kaysar was placed on the block alongside Kevin Campell by Head of Household Enzo Palumbo. Kevin won the Power of Veto, and Christmas Abbott went up in his place. Kaysar was evicted by an unanimous 10-0 vote.</p><p>Following his eviction, Kaysar was interviewed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">US Weekly</a>,&nbsp;where he discussed his&nbsp;month-long stay in the Big Brother&nbsp;house, the game play and more.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Asked about what he could have done differently, Kaysar explained how tiring it was to try and convince his houseguests "to do something else." Kaysar also said that if he had won HOH, it could have changed the season entirely.</p><p>"Everybody knows that I tried," Kaysar said. I was so out of breath from the amount of talks and speeches I had to give to motivate people to change direction, to do something else....And I think the catalyst would have been me getting power that would shaken things up. Then they would have disassociated themselves with whatever they had.</p><p>"But it was more like 'you got to give me something to go to if, if I would go to leave what I have now.' Looking back, I think that’s probably what that was about. So I can’t blame them. I knew I had friends in the house and I can tell people so badly wanted to follow me into a burning building. And in some cases, and I think had, I really went in, went for it and just shook things up, I think I would have been the one to kind of light that match, but I believe that they would’ve come with me once the fire started."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Kaysar emphasized that he was fine leaving the house due to&nbsp;uneventful&nbsp;game play from his fellow houseguests.</p><p>"Please vote me out of this house if you’re not going to change anything! I’ll happily leave if this is the kind of game that you guys want to play," Kaysar said.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Big Brother" Legend Janelle Pierzina Wants To Be On "Survivor"</a></strong></p><p>Asked about the possibility of returning for a fourth Big Brother season, Kaysar&nbsp;had a humorous response.</p><p>"You know what, maybe I’ll come for another four weeks. I can get evicted. Who knows, that seems to be my track record. It’s really like a 12-week commitment for everyone else. It’s a four-week commitment for me. So why not?"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In many ways, Big Brother 22 hasn't lived up to the sky-high expectations that fans had. One just had to take a quick scroll through Twitter following the evictions of Janelle and Kaysar to see that. Several Big Brother legends <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have also frequently voiced their frustration</a> with the season and some of the houseguests on social media.</p><p><strong><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>David Schwimmer Still Thinks Ross & Rachel Were On A Break</a></span></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmrZ2cmsOqv8iopWiamZx6o77OrZ%2Beql2grrq%2FwKtkmqScYsC1rdFmqp6Zo6S7brHVopqtoZ%2BjeqitzJ5kqaSRrnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
