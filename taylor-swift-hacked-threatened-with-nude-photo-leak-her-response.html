Over the holidays, the same group apparently took down the entire PlayStation and Xbox Live gaming networks. They were also reportedly responsible for Monday evening's temporary Facebook and Instagram issues.</p><p>Someone from Swift's team promptly deleted the tweets, but the hackers claimed that they had access to nude photos of the 1989 hitmaker (via <a href=#>The Verge</a>). The accounts @lizzard and @veruser were suspended by Twitter as of Tuesday afternoon.</p><p>Swift, 25, meanwhile, took to her <a href=#>Tumblr</a> to address the hacking. "My twitter got hacked but don't worry," she wrote to fans. "Twitter is deleting the hacker tweets and locking my account until they can figure out how this happened and get me new passwords. Never a dull moment."</p><p>After her account was unlocked, Swift responded to the intrusion with several lighthearted tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>Cause the hackers gonna hack, hack, hack, hack, hack…</p><p>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>January 27, 2015</a></p><p>I'd like to acknowledge the MVP of the day, <a href=#>@yelyahwilliams</a>, for being the first to text me about the hack this morning. <a href=#>#FriendshipGoals</a></p><p>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>January 27, 2015</a></p><p>PS any hackers saying they have 'nudes'? Psssh you'd love that wouldn't you! Have fun photoshopping cause you got NOTHING.</p><p>— Taylor Swift (@taylorswift13) <a href=#>January 27, 2015</a></p><p>The "Blank Space" singer also used her Tumblr on Tuesday to write a sweet message to a bullied fan named <strong>Caillou</strong>.</p><p>"I was really shocked to hear you say that you'd been bullied because of your name because the first thing I thought when I saw it was 'woah, Caillou is such a cool name,'" she wrote. "Honestly. I thought it was so cool because it's different, and herein lies our issue: you will always be criticized and teased and bullied for things that make you different, but usually those things will be what set you apart."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: "No one gets to have a place in your mind if they weren't invited there by you. So please do me this one favor: Don't let their ugly words into your beautiful mind." <a href=#>Read what she wrote to her bullies on Tumblr.</a></p><p>Swift is currently in Hawaii <a href=#>on a trip</a> with the Haim sisters.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdna6kt8SdZK2gopqutbHNnptmr5mptW661J2cZqiYpMGwecuemKRlYmV%2Bdn6WamY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
