Leaving NYC after her baby shower on Wednesday, February 20, the Duchess of Sussex was spotted wearing the $850 Jennifer Meyer 18-karat yellow gold “Mummy” necklace that is all kinds of cute.
While it’s unclear if the pregnant royal was gifted the piece during her shower or already had it in her collection, it’s the first time she’s been seen wearing the design that features the popular English pronunciation of “mommy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Looking like a native New Yorker ahead of her flight back to the U.K., she rocked a pair of $98 black <a href=# rel=noopener>Lululemon Align leggings</a> and a matching $88 <a href=# rel=noopener>Ingrid & Isabel Active Side Zip Jacket</a> with her Jennifer Meyer neckpiece. It’s the same combo we imagine her wearing during her beloved yoga practice.</p><p>But since she was heading to the airport and not the mat, she kept the all-black-everything mood going with her $180 <a href=# rel=noopener>Adidas UltraBoost sneakers</a> and $395 <a href=# rel=noopener>Cuyana Le Sud Leather Weekender</a> (while we doubt that was her only piece of luggage for her whirlwind trip to the Big Apple, we wouldn’t put it past the one-time lifestyle blogger to be an expert packer).</p><p>Oh, and let’s not forgot about that Rectify baseball cap. A far cry from the fascinators and tiaras we’ve grown accustomed to seeing Markle wear, it appears the causal topper may have actually been a <a href=# data-gift=1>gift</a> from one of her BFFs. Her friend and former Suits co-star <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong> </a>was seen arriving at the royal’s baby shower with the hat (a promotional item from her Netflix show), and then hours later she was rocking the same one. Coincidence? We think not.</p><p>Leave it to Duchess Meghan to give Us so much to obsess over with a seemingly simply athleisure ensemble. But there is a no denying the gold “Mummy” necklace is the most sentimental part of the look.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6KyqLTAp2SmmaKguaa%2FjKOcp6aZm7KzecyesJ6qXaLCrrnYZqWem5uhrqSxjJ2crZmZocBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
