While there certainly is some truth to that, the fact remains that people with connections in the acting and music worlds often have doors opened for them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the years, there have been many examples of <a href=#>children who followed in their famous parents’ footsteps</a> after they had doors opened for them. In fact, there even are some examples of <a href=#>kids that became more famous than their well-known parents</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Celebrities Worked Normal Jobs After Getting Famous</a></span></p><p>Of course, the majority of famous parents have kids that will never enter the entertainment industry. More than that, there are some stars whose kids seem especially certain <a href=#>they do not want to follow in their famous parent's footsteps</a>.</p><p>As one of Taylor Hawkins’ three children, Oliver Shane Hawkins grew up watching his famous father perform for the masses. With that in mind, it begs a question, will Taylor’s son (who typically goes by Shane) be one of the kids that tries to recreate their famous parents’ magic, or will he pave his own road?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>Updated on March 16, 2023:</strong> Oliver Shane Hawkins, who prefers to go by Shane, is now 17 years old. Shane appears to be following in his fathers footsteps, and luckily, it appears that music and keeping beat runs in his blood. The teen took home <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the 2022 Drumeo Award for Performance of the Year</a>.</p><p>While Hawkins' Instagram account looks pretty mainstream for how you would expect a teen boy's social media to appear, it is further proof that he is pursuing music as a part of his life. Not only does his bio include "Musician/Band... I play music and other stuff too," but his most recent photo (as of now) was posted in January of this year and shows off his music studio where he has drums, guitars, and various artist's decor.</p><h2 id=who-is-oliver-shane-hawkins-rsquo-father-taylor-hawkins>Who Is Oliver Shane Hawkins’ Father, Taylor Hawkins?</h2><p>When he was a young man, Sass Jordan tapped Taylor Hawkins to play drums for her, and then he got the chance to tour with Alanis Morrisette at the height of her career. Even years after Hawkins was best known for his role in another band, he credited his career to the opportunity Morrisette gave him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Taylor-Hawkins-20th-Annual-Bridge-School-Benefit-Concert.jpg><p>When Dave Grohl had worked with a different drummer during the early days of the Foo Fighters, the two musicians had a falling out. Grohl eventually decided to seek out a new drummer to join the band, and he called Taylor Hawkins looking for a recommendation. To Dave’s surprise, Taylor volunteered himself.</p><p>After Taylor Hawkins became a member of the Foo Fighters in the late 90s, he would go on to become the band’s second most recognizable member, only behind frontman Dave Grohl. A member of the band for more than twenty years, Taylor played on many of the band’s most popular songs.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Foo-Fighters-and-Bevy-Smith-Rock-and-Roll-Hall-of-Fame-red-carpet.jpg><p>On top of being a member of the Foo Fighters, Taylor Hawkins played with and founded other bands. Hawkins was the frontman for the bands the Coattail Riders and The Birds of Satan, and Taylor also played drums for a band called Anyone.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Foo Fighters Aren't Disbanding After Losing Its Beloved Drummer</a></span></p><p>As a member of the Foo Fighters, Taylor Hawkins was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2021. Even though it seemed clear that Taylor was set to continue playing music for many years to come, that tragically is not how things worked out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On March 20th of 2022, Taylor Hawkins performed with the Foo Fighters at the Lollapalooza Argentina festival. Five days later, emergency services were called to a hotel where Taylor was staying because he was suffering chest pains. When the paramedics arrived, Taylor had become unresponsive and he was declared dead on the scene.</p><h2 id=is-taylor-hawkins-rsquo-son-oliver-shane-hawkins-going-to-become-a-musician-like-his-dad>Is Taylor Hawkins’ Son, Oliver Shane Hawkins, Going To Become A Musician Like His Dad?</h2><p>After Taylor Hawkins suddenly passed away, that news left the music world and his fans in a worldwide shock. After all, Taylor was only fifty years old at the time he took his last breath, and he always seemed so full of life.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>8 Touching Tributes To Foo Fighters Drummer Taylor Hawkins</a></span></p><p>Seemingly universally beloved by all of his peers and everyone he met, Taylor Hawkins' passing was met by a slew of musicians who paid tribute to his skill as a musician. More importantly, just as many, if not more, people wrote or spoke about how nice Taylor was as a human being.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of how many people loved and respected Taylor Hawkins, a pair of tribute concerts in his honor were planned. During the first of those two concerts, some big name musicians played, including Paul McCartney and Travis Barker, who both performed with the Foo Fighters.</p><p>During easily the most talked about moment of the tribute concert from Wembley Stadium, a very special drummer performed with the Foo Fighters. Before the Foo Fighters performed “My Hero,” Taylor Hawkin’s son <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Shane Hawkins joined them on the drums</a>.</p><p>Of course, seeing Taylor Hawkins’ son Oliver Shane Hawkins perform with his father’s famous band was a truly amazing moment to behold. However, if Shane was a bad drummer, the moment would have been a little bit awkward... though it still would have been touching.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fortunately, when Oliver Shane Hawkins performed with the Foo Fighters, it was clear that he is a talented drummer. With that in mind, it left many observers wondering if Shane would become a professional drummer like his dad.</p><p>Considering that Oliver Shane Hawkins is still in his teens, it would be pretty wild for strangers to pretend they know what kind of career he will have as an adult. That said, there certainly are indications that Shane could be destined to play music for a living in the future.</p><p>On top of playing drums with the Foo Fighters at the Taylor Hawkins tribute concert, in July 2022, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oliver Shane Hawkins played drums on “My Hero” with a band called The Alive</a>. While the group performed at a Laguna Beach block party, Shane seemed right at home behind the drums with The Alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Considering that Oliver Shane Hawkins must have put in hours on end to be as good at the drums as he is, he almost certainly must have a passion for music. If that someday results in Shane following in his father’s footsteps, there will be millions of people there rooting for him.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuu8uirZ6qXai1orrEZp%2Bar5ueu7R505qwpaeiYrWiw8qipaxlopq5osDIqKWsoJmlfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
