AEW has built a strong relationship with Warner Brothers Discovery (formerly known as WarnerMedia). The company’s weekly television shows, AEW Dynamite, Rampage, and Collision, air on TBS and TNT. The recent addition of Collision was a sign that WBD clearly wanted more AEW content. As AEW continues to expand its lineup, fans continue to wonder whether the library could end up on a streaming service, like WBD’s MAX."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The company’s weekly television shows, AEW Dynamite, Rampage, and Collision, air on TBS and TNT. The recent addition of Collision was a sign that WBD clearly wanted more AEW content.</p><p>As AEW continues to expand its lineup, fans continue to wonder whether the library could end up on a streaming service, like WBD’s MAX.</p><p>Speaking with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mike Johnson of PWInsider</a>, Khan commented on a potential streaming service for AEW. He noted that Warner Brothers Discovery currently have their streaming rights. Khan also highlighted the strength of their relationship. The AEW CEO then pointed out the depth of AEW’s content library.</p><p>“Well, if you live abroad, there’s a great streaming service AEW Plus that we’ve put together for international,” Khan said. “Domestically, all of our streaming rights are held exclusively by Warner Brothers Discovery. They also have all of our domestic TV rights exclusively, which has been great and has helped drive the launch of AEW Collision, which has been such a great success and in addition to Rampage and Dynamite, where we again celebrate episode 200 tonight of Wednesday night Dynamite on TBS. And that relationship is really important to us.</p><p>“The streaming rights is something that they’ve put a lot of thought into. You know, as of tonight, again, there’s 200 episodes of Wednesday night Dynamite. There’s over 100 episodes of Friday night Rampage. And we’ve now going into this week this will be episode eight of Saturday Night Collision, and that’s a really strong collection that we’re building there. And we’ve also had about 20 huge pay-per-view events, and hundreds of episodes of AEW Dark, and 1000s of hours that I own outside of the AEW catalog of Ring of Honor footage that includes some of the biggest stars in all of pro wrestling today and all time.</p><p>Khan went on to note that he believes they have the bones for a strong streaming platform. He made it clear that AEW would be a strong addition to a streaming service before he stated that his dream is for the library to land on MAX. Khan also noted that he believes AEW’s streaming service will happen, and it’s ultimately up to WBD.</p><p>“When you look at all that, I think we have all the bones for a really, really strong streaming platform,” Tony Khan said. “I think it would be a very strong addition to any streaming platform. And my dream is that it all lands on MAX. I think it would be tremendous; right now, AEW: All Access is available on that, which is very cool. And hopefully, that’s a step in the right direction of getting our stuff streaming.</p><p>“We’ve got a great library altogether with everything I own. It’s 1000s of hours of great wrestling. And the AEW catalog has grown so much, considering it was stuff we bootstrapped and started the thing from scratch four years ago. And I believe the streaming service will happen. As to where it is and what platform it is that is something that I believe largely will be influenced by Warner Brothers.”</p><p>Tony Khan previously stated that he believes AEW can potentially expand its streaming revenue.
