She is truly in a class of her own, and at this point, she has nothing left to do in regard to cementing her legacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The singer initially rose to fame as part of Destiny's Child, a smash hit singing group that was hugely successful. That would have been more than enough for some, but Bey busted out and went solo, igniting what has become one of the most successful recording careers of all time.</p><p>Since going solo, she has released one massive hit after the next, has sold millions of records, and has sold out the most prestigious concert venues in the world. Oh, she also headlined the Super Bowl Halftime Show, for good measure.</p><p>Going solo was clearly the move to make for the singer all those years ago, and she has had a plethora of hits that have helped her forge her legacy in the music industry.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Did Kelis Get Royalties From Beyoncé Sampling Her Song?</a></span></p><h2 id=her-song-39-single-ladies-39-was-a-massive-success>Her Song 'Single Ladies' Was A Massive Success</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2008, Beyoncé had the whole world singing "Single Ladies," which remains one of her most popular songs of all time. Not only is the song iconic, but so is its music video and its corresponding dance.</p><p>Beyonce's use of black and white was a bold style choice, and one that she was deliberate about.</p><p>"I was so exhausted and annoyed with these formulaic corporate companies that I based my whole next project off of black-and-white photography, including the videos for ‘Single Ladies’ and ‘If I Were a Boy,’ and all of the artwork by Peter Lindbergh for I Am…Sasha Fierce, which ended up being my biggest commercial success to date. I try to keep the human feeling and spirit and emotion in my decision making," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she said in an interview</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A key thing to note about this song is that The-Dream left his mark on it. The acclaimed songwriter and producer linked up with Beyoncé for this massive hit, and it kicked off a solid working relationship between the duo.</p><p>Beyoncé's and The-Dream has done some brilliant work with one another through the years, and in an interview, the acclaimed figure dished on what it was like to work with Beyoncé in the studio.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Beyoncé Ordered An Entire Security Team To Drop Blue Ivy Off At Preschool And It Cost A Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=the-dream-opened-up-about-working-with-beyonce>The-Dream Opened Up About Working With Beyoncé</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to him</a>, "This is the easiest thing because if she doesn’t sleep, I don’t sleep. It is Virgo season with her and me in there. I don’t sleep either I can stay in there in the red bullet."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This here is a pretty good indicator of just how hard Beyoncé works when no one is looking. Yes, she has always had the powerhouse talent, but this shows that she goes above and beyond to ensure that her albums are of the highest quality, something that fans have come to expect.</p><p>This is not the only time that The-Dream has talked about working with the famed singer. Earlier this year, he made a Twitter post talking about working with Beyoncé yet again, and it had similar vibes to his previous interview.</p><p>"I Love Making You Guys Happy and even if for a second I can give anything of my self to help get you through a moment in these crazy times I’d use my entire heart to do so. No one’s fucking sleeping tonight! @Beyonce we have done something special yet again my good friend," he wrote.</p><p>This was for the song "Break My Soul," which went on to do some impressive things on the Billboard charts after it was released this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Beyoncé Gets High Praise From Grace Jones In New Interview</a></span></p><p>Beyoncé remains one of the biggest artists in the game for a reason, and it's amazing to hear just how tirelessly she works when crafting something for her adoring fans.
