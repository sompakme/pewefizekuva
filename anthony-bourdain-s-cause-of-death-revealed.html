The result was,&nbsp;as suspected- suicide. Prosecutor Christian de Rocquigny told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Associated Press</a> on Saturday that the host of CNN series Parts Unknown used the belt of his hotel bathrobe. Monsieur Rocquigny confirmed that “there is no element that makes us suspect that someone came into the room at any moment.” He also mentioned that a medical expert has examined Bourdain’s body during the autopsy and found no sign of resistance. Toxicology tests are still being carried out. The purpose was to find out if Bourdain took any medication or not, with the hope to give his family some kind of closure.</p><p><strong>RELATED: <a href=#>CELEBRITY CHEF ANTHONY BOURDAIN FOUND DEAD</a></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bourdain’s girlfriend, Italian actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Asia Argento</a>, said in a statement: “Anthony gives all of himself in everything that he did.
