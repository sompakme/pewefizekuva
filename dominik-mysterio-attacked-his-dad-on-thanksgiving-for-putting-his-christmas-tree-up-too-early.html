The young star responded by saying that Rey had his Christmas tree up before November was over, so he had to catch some hands. He also noted that he wanted to get revenge for having to live in his father’s shadow.</p><p>“Because he had his Christmas tree up before November was over, and honestly he doesn’t deserve to just be living peacefully,” Dominik said. “I had to live with his shadow my whole life. So I’m hoping to cast a big shadow over him and just keep torturing him as much as I can.”</p><p>Ripley then chimed in by saying that she and Dominik were trying to be peaceful, but Rey disrespected them, and they couldn’t stand for that</p><p>“It was great. We went in there trying to be nice, trying to be civil. We were hoping that we could have a nice little family get together and just have Thanksgiving together, enjoy it. But you know, Rey, he once again shut the door on Dominik. He disrespected myself and Dominik by closing that door, so I wasn’t having it. Then of course he called me a name, and Dominik snapped. That’s what happens when you’re being a bad influence in front of the children at the table. He’s trying to take the spotlight once again for himself, and we’re not gonna stand for it.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>"He doesn't deserve to just be living peacefully." <a href=#>@DomMysterio35</a> explains why he attacked his father <a href=#>@reymysterio</a> in his home on thanksgiving. <a href=#>#WWETheBump</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/cr1uonE6Rp</a></p><p>— WWE (@WWE) <a href=#>November 30, 2022</a></p><p>Dominik, Ripley, and their stablemates in The Judgment Day (Damian Priest and Finn Balor) are riding high into December; they defeated The O.C. on the November 28 episode of WWE RAW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJsaWtraWKxsLnIp6CkZZ2uwLWx0aKmZpmkqa6kt8SdZKGho2KxorCMqKVmrJiWu6y%2FxqKtoqaXYrOwvoyprK2smaO0brTIrGScoKKewLW5wKxkraqVmnq2vIytpqhllZa%2FrcU%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
