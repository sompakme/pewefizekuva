I want to at least finish school first and then get our heads on straight and then talk about marriage,” Alana stressed.</p><p class=p1>Alana is currently in college, studying to be a nurse.</p><p class=p1>“I just finished my first year, so I’m going into my second,” Alana said. “It was very hard for my first year because everything with <strong>Anna [Cardwell]</strong> and just trying to get adjusted to Colorado and college, but my second semester went a lot smoother and I feel like I did a lot better that semester and I think I finally got the hang of [the fact that] I’m in college. I still think sometimes I’m [just] walking around campus.
