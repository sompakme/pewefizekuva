I can’t turn back the clock.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Alleged Sex Offender R.

In 1977, Polanski fled the United States after pleading guilty to the statutory rape of a 13-year-old girl. He has since been accused by other women of raping them as minors.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This isn’t the first time Winslet has expressed regret for working with Allen and Polanski. At the London Film Critics’ Circle Awards in 2018, she acknowledged that she had made “poor decisions” when working with some directors, though she didn’t mention names. Winslet made the statement after Dylan Farrow, as well as, Blake Lively and Greta Gerwig called her out for supporting Allen.</p><p>Now, the actress says she’s being more selective in the roles she takes, keeping in mind the legacy she will leave behind. “We’re handing them a pretty f*cked up world, so I’d like to do my bit in having some proper integrity,” she said.</p><p>Although the allegations against Allen and Polanski date back several decades, the two directors have continued to work steadily. However, in light of the #MeToo movement, many actors are now refusing to work with them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2017, Allen, 84, filmed A Rainy Day In New York with Timothée Chalamet, Selena Gomez and Rebecca Hall, among others. Amazon Studios, however, refused to distribute the film and the three stars donated their salaries to charity.</p><p>Meanwhile, Polanski, who lives and works in France, won Best Director at France's 2020 Cesar Awards for An Officer and a Spy, a decision that has sparked protests due to the rape charges that the 87-year-old director still faces.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>HuffPost</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Goldbergs' Bryan Callen Accused Of Rape, Sexual Misconduct</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8qaq55lp567tLjErWSrnZensrW%2FjLCmq6OZo7Ruw8itn2avn6SxunnApaOepl2nvK6tzWanqKSRo8CstY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
