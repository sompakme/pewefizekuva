Balducci died on July 26, 2020, at the age of 44.</p><p>In 2001, Charlie and his wife Sabrina Balducci appeared on the MTV reality series where MTV cameras documented their journey to the altar for 4 months. On the day of the wedding, the limo driver was running late, prompting Charlie to threaten the limo driver, “I will gut you like the f–king piece of s–t you are. I’ll hunt you down like f–king cattle.”</p><p>In an interview with 20/20, Balducci said: “In defense of myself, I really did what any Staten Islander would have done in that situation.”</p><p>His wife said, “Picture somebody in your house, following you at every event you did, every place you went, for four months. You’ve got a newborn baby, you’re trying to plan a wedding.”</p><p>Balducci concluded, “She had her freak-outs, too. It’s just that my freak-out trumped everything else.”</p><p>Charlie was the president and founder of NYC Arts Cypher, a non-profit arts organization that promotes positive values through arts and entertainment programs, projects, and events.</p><p>Balducci dedicated his life to promoting art on the borough, founding the nonprofit organization NYC Arts Cypher in 2006.

NYC Arts Cypher is located at 12 Broad St., surrounded by murals painted by its members.</p><p>During the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, NYC Arts Cypher offered classes virtually.
