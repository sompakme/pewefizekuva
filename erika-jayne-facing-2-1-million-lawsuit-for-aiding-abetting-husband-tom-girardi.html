Even though she filed for divorce from her husband in 2020, Jayne&nbsp;recently found herself <a href=#>pulled into another lawsuit</a> due to her husband’s alleged criminal activities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As per <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, Jayne&nbsp;and her company EJ Global, LLC were named in the complaint filed with the court last Thursday. The lawsuit was submitted on behalf of lawyer Manuel H. Miller and Kathleen Bajgrowicz, the mother of NFL star Chuck Osborne who died in 2012 following head trauma.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Kanye West's 'Donda 2' Will Only Be Available On $200 Stem Player, Boycotts Spotify & Apple</a></span></p><p>Girardi&nbsp;and Miller previously represented Bajgrowicz when she launched a lawsuit against the NFL following her son’s death. Girardi&nbsp;was responsible for distributing the funds from a settlement reached with the NFL to Miller and Bajgrowicz but provided a variety of reasons for why he could not.</p><p>Now, Miller and Bajgrowicz are suing Girardi&nbsp;to get the funds they argue they’re owed. But they also argue that Jayne&nbsp;is responsible, too, since she was aware of her husband’s actions. They’re hoping for a successful win of $2.1 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plaintiffs argue that Jayne&nbsp;“aided and abetted” her husband as he embezzled money through his law firm, Girardi & Keese. The lawsuit argued that she&nbsp;was fully aware her husband’s crimes&nbsp;were “funding her notoriously lavish lifestyle.”</p><p>"Defendants knew that Plaintiffs were fraud victims but did nothing to protect them and instead prioritized their own financial gain at Plaintiffs' expense," the court documents read.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star’s lawyer has already responded to the allegations to deny all wrongdoing.&nbsp;"Erika has no law degree and never worked at or managed her former husband's law firm," said Evan C. Borges, who claims the lawsuit is a way to shift the blame onto Erika.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jayne, 50, originally <a href=#>filed for divorce</a> from Girardi, 81, in November 2020. Only a month later, however, the couple was slapped with a lawsuit for allegedly trying to use their divorce to embezzle money. More of Girardi's&nbsp;former clients have spoken out since then with various allegations of wrongdoing.</p><p>Jayne's&nbsp;legal team has denied she had any part in her husband’s criminal activity from the start, but she’s continued to be named in lawsuits. Last July, for instance, <a href=#>a judge ruled that three of Girardi’s former clients</a> can sue Jayne&nbsp;to try to reclaim the $11 million the lawyer owed them after a settlement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The reality star has also been ordered to turn over a variety of personal assets to make up for her husband’s debts, <a href=#>including a pair of $750,000 earrings</a>.</p><p>The former couple's&nbsp;legal troubles remain ongoing. However, Girardi&nbsp;was placed under a conservatorship last year following an Alzheimer’s and dementia diagnosis.</p><p>Sources: <a href=#>PEOPLE Magazine</a>, <a href=#>Vulture</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSys7XKmmSjmamjsm5%2BjKagpaSZpLtuuMCwqq6hpGKuqrDIp55mrJ%2Bieqi10ZqpnaFf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
