However, Travis reportedly spent $5.5 million on the luxurious ride after customizations.</p><p>But Travis’ ride was quick to spark backlash from the public, including the family of 9-year-old Ezra Blount, who died during the crowd surge of the 2021 edition of Astroworld Festival.</p><p>Speaking to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, the family’s attorney, Bob Hillard, said Travis’ sports car isn’t a good look for.

It’s been reported that the total value of <a href=#>all the lawsuits is over $10 billion</a>.</p><p>10 people died at the Astroworld Festival, including several minors.
