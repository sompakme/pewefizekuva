He was honest about how happy he was about his nomination, and wasn't afraid to say that recognition was one of the main things actors strive for.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ttweb_the-truth-about-tom-holland-and-zendaya-s-relationship_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="The Truth About Tom Holland And Zendaya's Relationship ">The Truth About Tom Holland And Zendaya's Relationship</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Fans loved the idea of Tom Holland and Zendaya together even when they denied they were a couple.</p><p>He was accompanied by his brother, and walked the red carpet alone. This happened in the midst of rumors that he and Zendaya were splitting up, but he didn't seem bothered about it. In fact, despite not giving any specifics, he appeared hopeful and happy about both his professional and his personal life.</p><h2 id=tom-holland-39-s-response-to-the-breakup-rumors-was-definitive>Tom Holland's Response To The Breakup Rumors Was Definitive</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tom-holland-zendaya-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Holland and Zendaya are one of the hottest celebrity couples right now, and that unfortunately means that <a href=#>both breakup and marriage rumors are constantly going around</a>. Especially considering that the couple are known for valuing their privacy, and <a href=#>not sharing details about their intimacy</a> unless absolutely necessary. The rumors are usually meaningless and fade quickly. This time, though, it seemed people were convinced they had broken up for good. The proof? The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">actress had unfollowed him on Instagram</a>. That could be mildly suspicious, if Zendaya hadn't unfollowed literally everyone after announcing several projects for this year, a PR move that many big stars do.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ttweb_zendaya-s-insane-movie-and-tv-show-salaries-have-changed-her-net-worth-forever_bk_a1-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Zendaya's Movie And TV Show Salaries Have Increased Her Net Worth Drastically">Zendaya's Movie And TV Show Salaries Have Increased Her Net Worth Drastically</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Shows like Zapped and HBO's Euphoria, as well as blockbusters like Spider-Man: No Way Home and Dune, have made Zendaya a very rich woman.</p><p>So, of course, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor was fed up with everyone speculating about his love life</a>, and when he was finally asked if they had split up, he sternly replied <strong>"absolutely not"</strong>. Being one of Hollywood's most beloved couples, this answer was great news for a lot of people. But then, when Tom Holland showed up solo at the 2024 Critics Choice Awards only a day after denying the rumors, it raised questions again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tom-holland-feels-39-secure-and-happy-39>Tom Holland Feels 'Secure And Happy'</h2><span class=txt>Close</span><p>It shouldn't have been a surprise that Zendaya wasn't with Tom on the red carpet of the Critics Choice Awards. After all, they haven't walked red carpets together throughout their relationship unless it was a project they were both a part of. Maybe not to steal each other's spotlight? Who knows... But of course, after the rumors, it did raise some questions. Tom Holland wasn't bothered, though. In fact, he was in very high spirits, hopeful not only about the present but also the future. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He said he's excited about new projects</a> and that he's <strong>"very creatively driven to sort of do some new things and push myself in ways I didn't think I could."</strong> He has <strong>"a few things under the radar"</strong> that he's not ready to share yet, but judging by how he shared the news, they will probably be very exciting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside of his career, the actor also shared a little snippet of his personal life. Nothing concrete, of course, but he did express that he feels <strong>"very secure and happy, and I'm enjoying life".</strong></p><p>With their relationship apparently going strong, Zendaya's upcoming projects such as Challengers and Dune: Part Two, and Tom Holland's exciting next step in his acting career, it's safe to say that this celebrity power couple is living one of their best moments, and no petty rumors could change that.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirqKVdnbytuMCnm2aqlaHCpMDAp6tmmZKkwrV5xa6rrqqVYr2zu8memq2rXafCrrvRrGSznZ6ZrrqtjJupnpmbqr1w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
