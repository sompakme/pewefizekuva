Starring <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Jason Bateman</a>, Laura Linney as Marty and Wendy Byrde, the family who fall into a dangerous situation with money laundering and a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Mexican drug cartel</a>. Julia Garner has also gained critical acclaim for her performance as Ruth Langmore. Fans may have caught Garner in the new Netflix miniseries Inventing Anna.</p><p>Netflix released half of Ozark’s fourth and final season earlier this year. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Republic World</a>, Part 2, consisting of seven episodes is scheduled to release on Aug. 31, 2022.</p><p>While Bateman and Linney have made a name for themselves before joining the series, other stars of the series have launched a new career in the process. Check out the net worth of the cast of Ozark and what they’ve been doing outside of the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">hit television series</a>.</p><h2 id=skylar-gaertner-300-000>Skylar Gaertner – $300,000</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the role of Jonah Byrde, the young son in the family, audiences have watched him grow up before their eyes and in Season 4, he begins to make dangerous choices that may put his life or members of his family’s lives on the line. Gaertner has also appeared as Young Matt Murdock on <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Netflix’s Daredevil </a>and several independent films.</p><h2 id=sofia-hublitz-500-000>Sofia Hublitz – $500,000</h2><p>Charlotte Byrde (Hublitz) is Marty and Wendy’s daughter and is <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">quickly making a name</a> for herself. Ozark is the main source of Hublitz recognition and salary and audiences enjoy watching the young star develop a character that began as a quiet, passive girl to a young woman taking control of her environment.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;The Cast Of Netflix's Emmy-Winning Show 'The Crown' Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><h2 id=kevin-l-johnson-1-5-million>Kevin L. Johnson – $1.5 Million</h2><p>Johnson plays Sam Dermody, a man whose stroke of luck seems to be running out in Season 4 of Ozark. He’s been a supporting role for the cast since Season 1 and continues to show up as the man in which people find it easy to take advantage. Johnson has taken <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">numerous small roles in some high-profile projects</a>, building his reputation and net worth in the process.</p><h2 id=felix-solis-1-5-million>Felix Solis – $1.5 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He’s the one they all fear – Solis plays the bad guy in the Ozark series, Omar Navarro. As the series has progressed, fans have seen more and more of the drug cartel’s presence and Navarro has developed an uncanny and unique relationship with the Byrdes. Solis has also appeared in Made In Jersey, The Following and The Good Wife.</p><h2 id=lisa-emery-1-9-million>Lisa Emery – $1.9 Million</h2><p>Emery has been working supporting roles for many years but her role as Darlene Snell is perhaps her best known. Snell is the thorn in the Byrde’s side, the one with such <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">dangerous and impulsive moves</a>, she becomes a risk for anyone close to her.</p><h2 id=charlie-tahan-2-million>Charlie Tahan – $2 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We’ve seen Tahan in Gotham, Wayward Pines, Frankenweenie, Law & Order and I Am Legend but it’s his role as Wyatt Langmore that has caught the eye of many. His Langmore character has similar issues to his fictional brother and sister, Three and Ruth and he has a dependency on one of the Byrde’s worst enemies, Darlene Snell.</p><h2 id=damian-young-3-million>Damian Young – $3 Million</h2><p>Young is the character actor that causes fans to rack their brains on where they’ve seen him before. He looks so familiar because he’s been in shows like <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">House of Cards</a>, Californication, As The World Turns and many more. In Ozark, Young plays the shady Jim Rattlesdorf, the man leaving fans to wonder which side he’s on.</p><h2 id=julie-garner-3-million>Julie Garner – $3 Million</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Clearly, Ozark’s <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">breakout star</a>, Garner plays Ruth Langmore, a poor, country girl responsible for taking care of her two brothers. Langmore stumbles upon a deal with Marty Byrde, requiring her to use her sassy and witty skills to cover a massive money laundering operation. Garner earned an Emmy for her performance in Ozark and we may see additional nominations from her starring role in Inventing Anna.</p><h2 id=laura-linney-10-million>Laura Linney – $10 Million</h2><p>Linney has decades of acclaimed work in <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Love Actually</a>, The Truman Show, John Adams and many more. It’s no wonder, she co-stars in Ozark as a woman with the ability to blend in like a chameleon. She’s business savvy, smart, cunning and manipulative all at the same time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jason-bateman-30-million>Jason Bateman – $30 Million</h2><p>Bateman is cashing in approximately $300,000 per episode of Ozark but his work in Hollywood from the early 1980’s makes him the most successful among the cast. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, Bateman starred in <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Arrested Development </a>and films like Couple’s Retreat, Horrible Bosses and Juno. As the father and husband of the Byrde clan, it was Marty Byrde that started this mess, working within questionable financial dealings and making agreements with the wrong people.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Netflix To Put $135 Million Into French, European Movies Over Three Years</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Republic World&nbsp;</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">The Things</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2ForrKoqWgZaSdsm6vwKyrZqeWYrumwMWloLGrXaTHor7KZpmyZZ6awW7DzquroWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
