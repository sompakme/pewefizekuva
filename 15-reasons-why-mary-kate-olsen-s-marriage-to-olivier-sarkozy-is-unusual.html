We've seen the Hollywood star grow up from being a fun-loving youngster solving mysteries and starring in a bunch of movies with her twin sister Ashley, to becoming a very successful businesswoman; owning a fashion line, becoming co-president of Dualstar with her sister, writing a book, and at the age of 23, was the youngest person to join the elite Council of Fashion Designers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Mary-Kate isn't busy with work, you'll probably spot her with husband Olivier Sarkozy. His name might sound familiar to you, since he is the half-brother of Nicolas Sarkozy, the former President of France. The couple has been married since 2015 and seems to be going strong. While their age difference (he's 48 and she's 31), may seem shocking, there are way more bizarre and unusual things we just had to point out about this duo's relationship.</p><p>From Sarkozy's ex-wife calling out Mary-Kate and describing the marriage as "grotesque" to showing off their wild and awkward PDA at a match at the U.S. Open, here are 15 reasons why Mary-Kate Olsen's marriage to Olivier Sarkozy is just odd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=olsen-s-husband-is-the-half-brother-of-the-former-french-president>Olsen's Husband Is The Half-Brother Of The Former French President</h2><p>Mary-Kate Olsen didn't just marry some actor or musician; the star started dating Olivier Sarkozy, a French banker, back in 2012 and married him in 2015. You may recognize his last name if you're familiar with French politics. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivier is the half-brother of Nicolas Sarkozy</a>, the former president of France who served from 2007 to 2012. We wonder what dinner would be like at the Sarkozy home. Nicolas' son, Jean, is the same exact age as Mary-Kate, so maybe they'll have something in common to talk about? Or maybe Mary-Kate blows their minds and shares her views on France's foreign affairs. Either way, we’d love to see how she and twin sister Ashley, who don’t have a big background in politics, keep a conversation going.</p><h2 id=olivier-was-ready-to-race-down-the-aisle>Olivier Was Ready To Race Down The Aisle</h2><p>Was it his age that made Olivier want to race down the aisle or was it that he was just so in love with Mary-Kate? Sarkozy is 17 years older than the Hollywood star, but it seems like the banker truly does admire Mary-Kate and her success. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The duo met at a party in 2012</a>, and at the time, Mary-Kate was supposedly complaining "about boys not being mature enough for her," so thankfully, she was at the right place and at the right time. After ten months of dating, it was rumored that Olivier wanted to marry Mary-Kate, however, the Full House star made him slow his roll and wait just a tad but longer. Olivier had to wait three years until he finally got to put a ring on it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-lived-in-a-13-5-million-townhouse-before-saying-i-do>They Lived In A $13.5 Million Townhouse Before Saying "I Do"</h2><p>Before the couple walked down the aisle and said their "I Do's," Olivier and Mary-Kate shared a love nest that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cost a whopping $13.5 million</a>. The townhouse, located in Turtle Bay, in Manhattan, featured a private garden, a hall of mirrors, a ballroom, a rooftop pool, an artist's studio and a built-in garage. The home is pretty nice for a couple who just dated for a couple of years. Page Six reported that the couple was looking for a home that had a bit more privacy and away from paparazzi and they got just what they were looking for. We rarely see Mary-Kate!</p><h2 id=sarkozy-s-ex-wife-thinks-the-marriage-is-bizarre>Sarkozy's Ex-Wife Thinks The Marriage Is Bizarre</h2><p>Olivier Sarkozy's ex-wife, Charlotte, had a lot to say about her former husband's new beau. Charlotte reportedly slammed her ex-husband for starting a relationship with a woman who was 25 at the time when Olivier was 42. When she spoke to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">National Enquirer </a>about the blooming romance, she said, "That's not right. It's grotesque." Yikes! Charlotte was also very concerned about having her two children, who she had with Olivier around Mary-Kate, who she believed had a bad reputation for partying. However, Mary-Kate has been spotted multiple times bonding with her two daughters and doesn’t seem fazed by Charlotte’s backlash towards her and the marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=his-children-tower-over-mary-kate>His Children Tower Over Mary-Kate</h2><p>Speaking of Olivier's children, the French banker has two kids, Julien, 16, and Margot, 14, with his ex-wife Charlotte. His children seem to be getting along great with Mary-Kate, with this photo showing<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the stepmom and Margot hanging out in the day</a>. With Mary-Kate being 5'2, Margot almost towers her stepmother and she'll probably do a lot more growing. In an interview with The Edit, Mary-Kate discussed being a wife and mother for Olivier's two kids, stating, "We’re lucky [working hard] comes quite naturally for us. We don’t need so much time to sit and think and ponder. But then I have a husband, two step-kids, and a life; I have to go home and cook dinner. I ride horses on the weekends.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=they-love-to-pack-on-the-pda>They Love To Pack On The PDA</h2><p>The couple definitely does not shy away from showing each other affection. They have been spotted multiple times kissing, locking hands and touching one another. At the 2014 U.S. Open, the couple was photographed snuggling, while taking in some tennis action. If you didn't know who the duo was, you might have found their PDA odd, especially since the media loves to talk about the couple's 17-year difference and how Sarkozy towers over his wife. However, Mary-Kate and Olivier have been doing a fantastic job staying away from the tabloids and spotlight despite what everyone say’s about their relationship.</p><h2 id=their-favorite-places-to-show-their-affection-seem-to-always-be-at-sporting-events>Their Favorite Places To Show Their Affection Seem To Always Be At Sporting Events</h2><p>For being private people, Mary-Kate and Olivier do not hesitate when it comes to showing public displays of affection, especially when they are at sporting events, where there are a ton of cameras. Are they trying to prove to the world that their marriage is the real deal? Regardless, the couple has been spotted at the U.S. Open and a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Knicks game</a> holding one another, laughing, canoodling and sharing kisses. These lovebirds are anything but shy when it comes to showing the world how much they care about one another. Some may find it distasteful, but when you both have millions of dollars, you can practically do whatever you want, wherever you want.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-french-press-loves-to-talk-about-their-relationship>The French Press Loves To&nbsp;Talk About&nbsp;Their Relationship</h2><p>Ever since Olivier Sarkozy and Mary-Kate Olsen's relationship was made official, the French press was all over the news, and not in a very good way. Olivier earned the nickname "the little French lover" among others and was constantly mocked. Tabloids were quick to slam the banker for his choice in girlfriend and expose a Sarkozy family trend of dating younger woman. The couple was becoming a national obsession and with Olivier's half-brother being the president of France, all sorts of dirty laundry was being exposed. However, all the nasty press didn't seem to bother the married couple that has been together for three years and continues to go strong.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-wedding-was-extremely-small>The Wedding Was Extremely Small</h2><p>When the couple got married, it wasn't some large extraordinary event with a ton of famous celebs and well-known politicians. Mary-Kate and Olivier decided to keep their wedding small and relatively low-key, with some 50 guests at a private residence in Manhattan. Sadly, Mary-Kate's on-screen dad, Danny, played by Bob Saget, did not attend, but confirmed that the dup did say their "I Do's" in 2015. "I'm very happy and I sent a Mazel tov text. I'm very happy. I love her very much. I hope they're happy," Saget said. We're still wondering how Mary-Kate's wedding dress looked like!</p><h2 id=the-wedding-was-a-tad-smoky>The Wedding Was A Tad Smoky</h2><p>It's not a secret that Mary-Kate Olsen is an avid smoker. There are tons of photos that have captured the star and her sister smoking&nbsp;and taking more than the necessary amount of smoke breaks. Apparently,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> the star's wedding featured </a>"bowls and bowls filled with cigarettes, and everyone smoked the entire night." That might be another reason why Olivier digs Mary-Kate so much; a French man and an Olsen twin who love to smoke are a match made in heaven, right? It's safe to say that their wedding must have been really smoky. Another thing that Mary-Kate made sure about was that everyone that attended her wedding turned off his or her cellphones.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-don-t-see-much-of-mary-kate-anymore>We Don't See Much Of Mary-Kate Anymore</h2><p>Where in the world is Mary-Kate Olsen? The star has kept a very low profile since her marriage to Olivier. Now that she is a wife and a stepmother, Mary-Kate has bigger obligations than trying to keep her name in the gossip magazines. A source for E! News stated that the star and her husband have flew under the radar because they've been spending a lot of time in Paris where Olsen has become "immersed" in Olivier's world. "Mary-Kate has a fabulous life with Olivier and they spend a lot of time in Paris where they are both very happy," the source said. The Hollywood starlet has literally gone from tabloid queen to a homebody.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ashley-s-starting-to-date-older-men-too-thanks-to-mary-kate>Ashley's Starting To Date Older Men Too Thanks To Mary-Kate</h2><p>There are a lot of articles on the Internet bashing the Olsen twins for having "daddy issues," but we'll stay quiet on that. However, like Mary-Kate, her twin sister Ashley seems to like dating a more mature and older man. Ashley has been photographed kissing a man by the name of Richard Sachs, a 58-year-old financer and art dealer. The pair were first spotted riding bikes together in the Hamptons and soon after were photographed on a double date with Mary-Kate and Olivier at a New York Knicks game. While reports say that the duo broke up, Ashley is known to date a men a lot older than her. She's been linked to visual artist George Condo, 59, and CEO of Oliver Peoples, David Schulte, 47.</p><h2 id=she-feels-like-she-has-to-be-more-domestic>She Feels Like She Has To Be More Domestic</h2><p>Mary-Kate has been working in Hollywood since she was a baby, and that $300 million net worth did not come from her sitting and doing nothing all day. However, the actress has taken herself out of the Hollywood spotlight to focus on her family. While there is a ton of pressure in her line of work, working on a fashion label and her other many businesses, she's admitted in an interview to Net-A-Porter's The Edit that there are pressures to be domestic too. This couple works hard, but it looks like they know how to balance time for both their work and family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-olivier-tell-mary-kate-to-stay-away-from-joining-the-cast-of-fuller-house>Did Olivier Tell Mary-Kate To Stay Away From Joining The Cast Of&nbsp;Fuller House?</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">When Fuller House aired on Netflix</a>, there were just two stars that were missing, Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen. The two starred as Michelle in the original 90's sitcom and had a full invitation to join the cast, but the creator of the show revealed that ahead of Season 3, he's stopped personally acting the twins to reprise their roles. "I've stopped asking, really I kind of gave up ... But when somebody rings a doorbell, the girls yell, 'It's always open!' on the show so that's kind of how we feel about the Olsen twins. The door is open,'" creator Jeff Franklin said. The twins don't seem like they'll ever be returning and it's been over seven years since we've seen them on any movie or television show. It doesn't appear that Olivier Sarkozy had anything to do with this, but it's still a major let down. Let's cross our fingers for a return.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=are-there-ever-going-to-be-children-in-their-future>Are There Ever Going To Be Children In Their Future?</h2><p>Mary-Kate is busy helping raise Olivier's two kids, but will there be a baby announcement for the couple anytime soon? According to InTouch Weekly, Sarkozy really wants to expand his family and have more kids, and both Mary-Kate and Olivier "have been ready to have a child for a while." A source stated that the star "takes her role as stepmother to those kids very seriously," and now that the actress's life is more down to earth, it's the best time for her to start thinking about having more children. Will their future child be the next fashion mogul or president of France?</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">independent.ie</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">bustle.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ny.curbed.com</a>,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> dailymail.co.uk</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">usmagazine.com</a>,&nbsp; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eonline.com</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">diply.com&nbsp;</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6s7HArKanq12stbp5zJqpsmWblsGmec6lqp6mo2K6or7RopignV2pvG67y6Ktop2iYsCivsqosbJlmah6trrUrKyapF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
