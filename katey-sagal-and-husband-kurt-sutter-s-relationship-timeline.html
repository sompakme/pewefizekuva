News</a> in 2009, adding, “He called me like a couple months later and asked me to coffee, and we went and kind of never left each other after that.”</p><p>The couple got married in 2004, years before sharing the screen on Sons of Anarchy. Sutter created the FX show, which aired for seven seasons from 2008 to 2014, and decided to cast his wife.</p><p>“I was very grateful that Kurt wrote me that role,” Sagal shared during an appearance on <a href=# rel=noopener>“Literally With Rob Lowe”</a> in April 2024, discussing her SOA character Gemma Morrow. The actress said the role was “originally smaller” but after Sutter pitched the show to FX, they wanted him to “make the mom part bigger.”</p><p>Sagal said it was a “fantastic” experience, praising her husband, who not only created the show but appeared in a recurring role as Otto Delaney.</p><p>“My marriage, [we’re] so supportive of each other, I would say,” Sagal said on the podcast. “He understood what it was that I could do and my frustration around not being able to really dig into something. He just stood by it and it’s kind of a testament to a good marriage.”</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Sagal and Sutter’s complete relationship timeline:</p><h3>October 2004</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Katey-Sagal-and-Husband-Kurt-Sutter-s-Relationship-Is-Long-Lasting-Their-Relationship-Timeline-200.jpg><p>Sagal and Sutter got married during a private ceremony hosted at their Los Angeles home.</p><h3>January 2007</h3><p>The couple welcomed their first child together, Esmé Louise, via surrogate.
