A baby boy born February 22, 2020,” the duo’s rep told Us at the time, noting that the now-38-year-old singer gave birth in Tel Aviv, Israel.</p><p>“<a href=#>We almost didn’t name him that</a> because people would assume I named him after <a href=#><strong>Leonardo DiCaprio</strong></a>,” the director, 58, told <a href=#><strong>Jimmy Kimmel</strong> </a>in June of the following year. “There’s nothing wrong with that, but … he’s named after my wife’s grandfather, but also because, just in our hearts, he was our little lion. So he’s a lion. That’s how we thought about him.”</p><p>The Tennessee native went on to gush about Leo’s milestones during the June 2021 <a href=#>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</a> appearance, saying that the toddler was already talking.</p><p>“<a href=#>They’re not necessarily words, but he makes himself understood</a>,” the Oscar winner explained to Kimmel, 54, at the time. “He can only say one word and that is ‘abba,’ which is the Hebrew word for ‘dada.’ And a third of the time, he means me. … Leo watches these baby TV [shows] and it’s all in Hebrew. I’m learning the Sesame Street version of Hebrew.”</p><p>The following month, the filmmaker told the CBS Sunday Morning audience that he gets emotional when he talks about Leo too much.</p><p>“I can’t even see his name written on a piece of paper without crying,” the Golden Globe winner said in July 2021. “It’s just he’s my little Leo. He’s my little lion. And I just see his name, L-E-O written down isolated. And it just, when it comes to him, he’s just the most charming human being I’ve ever met in my life.”</p><p>The actor also praised Pick at the time, explaining how she “changed” his reluctance to get married.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I met her. And we, we fell in love,” he said. “We had — have — a wonderful relationship. And she wanted to get married. And I did, too. And so, I married.”</p><p>Tarantino proposed to the Israel native in June 2017 after nearly eight years together. The pair wed in November 2018 in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGaqrZWjwaq6jK2Yq5meqbavu4ywoJ%2BdXZmur7XEpaOaZaCesKx51p6jnKedmnq1tMSiqWZqnpl6o63BsmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
