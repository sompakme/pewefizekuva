The exes ultimately <a href=#>called it quits</a> in June 2022 after reports circulated that Shakira caught the soccer player having an affair.</p><p>One month after their breakup, Piqué moved on with girlfriend <strong>Clara Chia Marti</strong>. He made things <a href=#>Instagram official</a> with Chia Marti in January 2023 shortly after Shakira dropped her collaboration with Argentinian DJ <strong>Bizarrap</strong> that <a href=#>seemingly shaded the couple</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shakira-Is-Very-Open-to-Casually-Date-Following-Her-Tumultuous-Split-from-Gerard-Pique-494.jpg><p>In November 2022, Us confirmed that Shakira and Piqué <a href=#>signed a custody agreement</a> for their children. The musician ultimately <a href=#>moved from Barcelona</a> to Miami with her boys to start fresh.</p><p>While Shakira has primarily focused on releasing new music, she’s had time to date. The Grammy winner was most recently linked to Miami Heat player <strong>Jimmy Butler</strong>. The pair were <a href=#>spotted out and about</a> in July 2023. A second source told Us in September 2023 that while things were progressing for the duo, Shakira wasn’t in a rush to jump into <a href=#>another relationship</a>.</p><p>“Shakira has a lot on her plate,” the insider said. “Her main priority is her kids and career. But she’s definitely optimistic about finding love again.”</p><p>Earlier this month, Shakira opened up about how she prioritized her and Piqué’s family over her own goals to <a href=#>accommodate his career</a>. (Piqué <a href=#>retired from FC Barcelona</a> in November 2022.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“For a long time I put my career on hold, to be next to Gerard, so he could play football,” she told The Sunday Times. “There was a lot of sacrifice for love.”</p><p>Now, Shakira is gearing up to release her <a href=#>12th studio album</a>, Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, which drops later this month. Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran, which translates to “women don’t cry anymore,” will allude to Shakira and Piqué’s split.</p><p>With reporting by Travis Cronin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoJGgtrOtjKKqZqegmrtuwM5mmpqrpZa5rcWMnZitnV2bvK24zrCgp59dnLKzrdGdZKmhoaqybr%2FPpaCtZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
