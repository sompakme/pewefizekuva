Pregnant with six children (their seventh was born while Josh was behind bars), Anna was pitied for her husband's crimes and what spectators considered a sad life with the Duggars.</p><p>Despite the public's criticism of Josh, Anna has publicly supported her husband, showing up to court, sharing positive commentary about Josh on social media, and continuing to affiliate with her in-laws. However, after she deleted her Instagram account and otherwise went dark on social media, fans were curious about what she was up to.
