Not only did he allegedly make $19 million following his low-budget Super Bowl ad, but the rapper has apparently made $12 million just from listening parties promoting his new trio of Vultures albums, the next two which are releasing later this year. The reports come after Ye admitted he nearly went bankrupt before the Super Bowl ad success.</p><p>As per Billboard, Kanye’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">five listening parties so far have made over $12 million</a>, though it’s unclear how much of that Kanye took home himself. All the events reportedly sold out quickly, despite being announced within only 72 hours of the actual performance.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kanye-bankruptcy-vultures.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Kanye Is Building Back His Billion-Dollar Fortune With ‘Vultures’ Release After Almost Going Bankrupt</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The rapper says he narrowly avoided bankruptcy after his Super Bowl ad garnered millions in sales for Yeezy.</span><p>The initial two listening events held in the United States (on February 8 at the United Center in Chicago and February 9 at the UBS Arena in New York) each garnered approximately $2.4 million in ticket revenue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While specific sales figures for the three European listening parties — held on February 22 at Milan Arena, February 24 at Unipol Arena in Bologna, Italy, and February 25 at Accor Arena in Paris — remain undisclosed, ticket prices were aligned with those of the U.S. shows, ranging from $140 to $220, meaning they probably brought millions in revenue, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/kanye-west-3.jpg><p>Kanye <a href=#>lost his billionaire status in 2022</a> following a series of antisemitic comments, which caused various brand to cut ties with him, including Adidas. Likewise, he’s faced <a href=#>reports of various lawsuits and other financial difficulties</a>, like not being able to afford the rent at Yeezy headquarters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, things looked like they were improving for Kanye earlier this year, and not because of his album drop to mixed reviews. His Yeezy <a href=#>Super Bowl ad generated over $19 million</a> in sales, the rapper claimed, which he said couldn’t have come at a better time – he was months away from bankruptcy.</p><p>"Hey y’all, this is Ye, and this is my commercial. And since we spent all the money on the commercial spot, we actually—we didn’t spend any money on the actual commercial. But the idea is I want you to go to yeezy.com,” Kanye said in the commercial, which was a selfie-style video filmed in his car.</p><p>Kanye’s <a href=#>net worth is estimated to be $400 million</a>, though it’s unclear how the success of his Vultures album and Super Bowl ad have increased his personal fortune. It’s expected Kanye will host more listening parties before dropping his next two Vultures album, a move which will likely be good for Ye’s bank account.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpJmerrJuw8Ssq2alkaCytHmQa2SmoZyhtrC6jK%2Bspaylp7K0ecuiqq2dnp67qHnPmqmtsV2jsqK%2By7Jkm5meoL%2B2vNNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
