Rumor has it, when Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes were dating, she had to stop wearing high heels. Tom Cruise is a short actor while Katie Holmes is around 5’11”. You would never know it, judging by the photos, that she is much taller than him.&nbsp;Apparently, Tom Cruise stood on a box for their wedding photos since the actress towered over him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For whatever reason, a tall woman can make a guy feel insecure. For the guys that are over 6-feet tall, this, of course, is never an issue and tall women will typically flock to them. In the celebrity world, though, things are completely different. Being a tall woman in the industry is a plus, especially if you want to be a model. When you are watching your favorite TV show, however, it’s a little hard to tell who is tall and who isn’t. These women who appear tall on TV are probably enormous in real life because TV can be deceiving. Check out these 15 female TV stars who are a lot taller than you think.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=laura-prepon-5-10><strong>Laura Prepon 5'10"</strong></h2><p>We definitely noticed Laure Prepon’s height in That 70’s Show as she towered over a lot of her castmates including Mila Kunis. These days, Prepon is on a very different TV series, but one that is no less popular. Orange is the New Black is a scandalous and controversial take on the life of a woman in prison. She is&nbsp;also a mother and&nbsp;happily married to Ben Foster who is definitely shorter than the actress, but he doesn’t seem to mind one bit. This&nbsp;tall beauty&nbsp;seems to have everything she’s ever wanted in life. “I never think of myself as any kind of sex symbol, but I get letters from all over, all sorts. It's really cool. I get a lot from inmates, which is kind of scary. But the best was the guy who wanted to send me a plane ticket to fly me to his prom.”</p><h2 id=lucy-lawless-5-11><strong>Lucy Lawless 5'11"</strong></h2><p>Remember this girl? She used to make us feel like badass when we tuned in to see who’s butt she was kicking in Xena: Warrior Princess. This girl isn’t messing around at 5’11,” and when she stands next to other women, the height difference can be quite apparent. She’s been in a few more TV series over the years including, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Ash vs Evil Dead, and Salem. She’s still rocking it in Hollywood, looking as badass as ever. She learned a lot while she was the Warrior Princess and some of those things have paid off in real life. “I was black and blue for about two years, but it's paid off tremendously. You know, if you get enough whacks, your reflexes pick up, and I've become quite good&nbsp;— if somebody throws keys or something, I can catch them.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=katie-holmes-5-10><strong>Katie Holmes 5'10"</strong></h2><p>Katie Holmes was the lanky girl that lived on the wrong side of the creek in Dawson’s Creek. That was where she got her celebrity status that catapulted her into the movie world. She may not have appeared to be bigger than her cast on Dawson’s Creek, but she was around the same height as the men and she was a lot taller than Michelle Williams. “[When people meet me] They always say, 'Oh, you're big.'" For the most part, since she left the creek behind, she has been in movies, though she did find herself in a few TV series such as The Kennedys, The Kennedys: Decline and Fall, and Ray Donovan. Her experience on Dawson’s Creek was a good one and considering it made her career, we would have to agree. “We had such a wonderful set of circumstances in Wilmington. Yes, the four of us became famous literally overnight, but we were in a small town and we always knew when people were coming down. We always knew when to behave.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwendoline-christie-6-3><strong>Gwendoline Christie 6’3″</strong></h2><p>Talk about being an Amazon, did you have any idea that Gwendoline Christie was 6’3”? She plays Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones and that couldn’t be a better role for a girl of her height. She would definitely be an intimidating person to be around. She has no problem even taking on the men in the show. She is fierce and a force to be reckoned with. She has also appeared on the TV series Top of the Lake, so she is definitely one busy woman. She doesn’t appear to be the least bit worried when it comes to height in the acting industry. “I love a challenge. And I love defying limitation, gender stereotypes, and people's expectations of me as an actress.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mandy-moore-5-10><strong>Mandy Moore 5'10"</strong></h2><p>The This Is Us star is 5’10”— not exactly a giant in the industry, but tall enough for men to think twice about dating her. As you can see, she even towers over some of her costars. Moore has had a long career in Hollywood, she started out as a singer and then went into making movies. These days, she is the voice of Rapunzel in the TV series Tangled which was inspired by the movie that she was also in. She currently plays the mother in This Is Us where she incorporates her singing talent. She feels very strongly about being a good role model. “I think it's flattering when people say I'm a role model, but I don't think I am. It depends on your outlook on the word 'role model.' I'm not perfect or anything. I just consider it a great compliment.”</p><h2 id=allison-janney-6-0><strong>Allison Janney 6'0"</strong></h2><p>We were shocked when we found out that Allison Janney of the TV show Mom was six feet tall. We totally couldn’t tell, could you? She certainly doesn’t seem that tall in real life. Though, she is a lot taller than her co-star Anna Faris who is&nbsp;very short. Not only has she been on the show for five years, but she’s been a veteran in the industry for quite some time. You might recognize her from movies such as Juno, 10 Things I Hate About You, Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children, and Girl on The Train. She’s incredibly talented as an actress and she is so funny on the TV show Mom. She was also nominated for an Emmy for it. “It's a great way to start the day, hearing you've been nominated for an Emmy. It's just thrilling.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adrianne-palicki-5-11><strong>Adrianne Palicki 5’11”</strong></h2><p>Adrianne Palicki is on the cusp of being six feet and you can see that every time she stands near her costars. This girl has been rocking it in Hollywood for quite some time. She’s also the queen of TV, being on one popular show after another. She’s most recently been seen in About a Boy, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and The Orville. She’s gorgeous and talented, though, it must be hard to find a man that is taller than she is. She does have some advice out there for men. “With all the care that women do and all the money we spend to maintain our hair, men can at least take the time to wash their face with a simple, inexpensive product that will soften their facial hair, so they're not hurting us when we go in for a kiss. Trust me, guys, women will want to kiss you more if you take care of your facial hair.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jane-lynch-6-0><strong>Jane Lynch 6'0"</strong></h2><p>Now this one we do believe. Whether we realized it or not while, watching the woman on the silver screen, this woman is an imposing figure. She’s not a girlie girl and at times, whether it's in real life or just in her roles, she can be intimidating at times. She’s never considered herself to be a beautiful woman, though she wouldn’t consider herself insecure either. “One of the few advantages to not being beautiful is that one usually gets better looking as one gets older; I am, in fact, at this very moment, gaining my looks.” She is another actress that has been in the industry for a while and has rocked out some pretty great TV shows such as Glee, Criminal Minds, Manhunt: Unabomber, and The Stinky & Dirty Show. We are looking forward to seeing what else she comes out with in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jennifer-coolidge-5-10><strong>Jennifer Coolidge 5'10"</strong></h2><p>We had no idea that Jennifer Coolidge was 5'10"! We’re not sure why, but she always gave us the impression that she was a short girl. We saw her way back in the day on the set of Friends, but these days, she's appeared in many TV series such as The Secret Life of the American Teenager, Fish Hooks, Hero Factory, Gravity Falls, and most recently,&nbsp;2 Broke Girls. She is a hilarious actress and often plays the “dumb girl” role. She says that because of those roles, many people assume that she is stupid in real life. “There's something about me that suggests I don't have an intelligent atom in me at all. So, people say things to me that they wouldn't say to other people. Insulting, condescending things. They don't think I notice. But, of course, I'm taking it all in.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=aisha-tyler-6-0><strong>Aisha Tyler 6'0"</strong></h2><p>This is another woman that towers over most of the females she works with. Aisha Tyler is 6-feet tall.&nbsp;Not only was she a host on the controversial talk show The Talk for&nbsp;6 years, she’s been in a ton of TV shows. You probably recognized her from the Ghost Whisperer, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, 24, XIII: The Series, Criminal Minds, and Archer. We look forward to seeing what she has in store for 2018 now that she has left The Talk. She says the best thing that you can do for yourself in your career and life is to embrace your weird. “The only concept or experience or core belief that I can attribute my other-ness to is that I just started out a weirdo and I stayed a weirdo. And it took me a long time to embrace my "outsidership" and see it as a strength rather than a weakness.”</p><h2 id=jenna-elfman-5-10><strong>Jenna Elfman 5'10"</strong></h2><p>Jenna Elfman is the stunning blonde that reaches a crazy 5’10”. Elfman started her career out on the TV show Dharma & Greg but she’s been in many TV series since then. Courting Alex was a show she got started in 2006 after she did a few movies. Since then, she’s been seen in Two and a Half Men, Accidentally on Purpose, Matumbo Goldberg, Damages, 1600 Penn, Growing Up Fisher, and most recently,&nbsp;Imaginary Mary. She’s definitely kept busy since Dharma & Greg and still looks as beautiful as ever. “And as a character, what I found very inspiring about playing Dharma, especially at that time, is that the women on television were more neurotic than they were free. And I thought, this is a rare bird and this is unique on television and I think it's really refreshing.” That’s what we loved about her as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=brooke-shields-6-0><strong>Brooke Shields 6'0"</strong></h2><p>It’s hard to believe that Brooke Shields is 6-feet tall. She’s always been insanely petite, so we never really saw her as a tall girl. Shields has been in the industry since she was a child, so she has a long list of credentials. She took a break from Hollywood, however, when she started her family, but when she did come back, she came swinging. She’s been in a ton of TV shows such as Army Wives, Mr. Pickles, Creative Galaxy, The Middle, Lipstick Jungle, and most recently,&nbsp;Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. She’s a hell of a talent and we love seeing her back on the silver screen. Shields has been through a lot in her life, but she always comes back stronger than ever. “Someone said adversity builds character, but someone else said adversity reveals character. I'm pleasantly surprised with my resilience. I persevere, and not just blindly. I take the best, get rid of the rest, and move on, realizing that you can make a choice to take the good.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=khloe-kardashian-5-10><strong>Khloe Kardashian 5'10"</strong></h2><p>Yes, even Khloe Kardashian is making the cut at 5’10” even though she has only been in TV shows that include her and her family like&nbsp;Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kourtney and Khloé Take Miami, Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, Khloé & Lamar, and Kocktails with Khloé. It’s really a wonder that this family hasn’t gotten sick of the many shows just about them. She is significantly taller than her siblings and when they are in pictures together, she literally towers over them. Since her divorce with Lamar, she's really turned her life around and made it her own again. “I bought Justin Bieber's house. He had, like, this nook under the stairs which I didn't need, so I covered it up. When I ran into him, he was like, 'What did you do with the nook? I used to go in there and play video games.' When I told him it was gone, he was so upset. I didn't think this 20-year-old boy would even care!”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blake-lively-5-10><strong>Blake Lively 5’10”</strong></h2><p>Blake Lively is a tall girl, though you wouldn’t really know that just by watching her on the big screen. Thankfully, she nabbed tall guy Ryan Reynolds because he is more than happy to have a gorgeous girl like Lively on his arm. Blake Lively made it big when she played the New York socialite Serena van der Woodsen on Gossip Girl. From there, she moved on to the big screen. Though Green Lantern was considered to be a flop, it wasn’t all bad since she met her husband on set. She was also in The Town, The Shallows, Café Society, and The Age of Adaline. Lively has always been a secure woman and maybe that’s because she doesn’t worry about other people’s opinions.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=queen-latifah-5-10><strong>Queen Latifah 5'10"</strong></h2><p>Queen Latifah is another stunner that has been in the industry for a while and we did not expect her to be 5'10". She’s been in a ton of TV shows over the years including her own show called The Queen Latifah Show. You probably remember her being on TV shows such as Single Ladies, Let's Stay Together, From the Bottom Up, and for the past two years, she’s been in The Rap Game. She is very grateful for the life that she has and the experiences she's had. “There are times you can't really see or even feel how sweet life can be. Hopefully, its mountains will be higher than its valleys are deep. I know things that are broken can be fixed. Take the punch if you have to, hit the canvas, and then get up again. Life is worth it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmoaGXnXqttcWeZmptXZuyrq3LnmStrl2owaK%2B0mauoaddlr%2BmedOao6WdomLBqa3NZrCorV2ptaq6ymg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
