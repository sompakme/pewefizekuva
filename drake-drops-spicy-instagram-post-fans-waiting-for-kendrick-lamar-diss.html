The pictures show the 37-year-old rapper standing with his arms across his chest, hanging with Sexyy Red, posing in a Princeton basketball jersey, looking out over his balcony, and performing while flames rise behind him.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The timing of this post was especially interesting, as, just hours before, <a href=#>Rick Ross</a> shared an Instagram story of himself riding around and smoking to K. Dot’s verse on “Like That.” The story post led many fans to believe that Rozay’s inclusion in We Don’t Trust You was no accident, and he also has issues with the 6 God. They have not collaborated in a few years, much like Drake and Future, so the conclusion is not far-fetched.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Rick Ross riding in his car listening to Kendrick Lamar’s verse on “Like That” from Future and Metro Boomin’s new album We Don’t Trust You. <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/NXQSGtFqfJ</a></p>— XXL Magazine (@XXL) <a href=# rel=nofollow>March 28, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Over the weekend, internet detectives discovered that both Rick Ross and NAV unfollowed Drake. As a troll response, Drizzy captioned another set of photos “I ain’t picking up I’m in Turks lil baby,” referring to NAV’s 2020 record featuring Gunna and Travis Scott.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The father of one also <a href=#>addressed the recent beef</a> in a passionate speech during his concert on Sunday (March 24). “A lot of people asking me how I’m feelin’,” he said to the crowd in Amerant Bank Arena. “I got my head up high, my back straight. I’m 10 f**king toes down in Florida or anywhere else I go. And I know no matter what there’s not a ni**a on this Earth that could ever f**k with me in my life.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Kendrick Lamar’s “Like That” verse targeted both Drake and J. Cole. The Compton rapper denounced the idea of there being a “Big 3” made up of the three of them, and countered by saying “It’s just Big Me.” He also directly referenced their collaboration “<a href=#>First Person Shooter</a>” and questioned the legitimacy of their friendship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-spotify wp-block-embed-spotify"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Lamar wasn’t the only person dissing Drake on We Don’t Trust You. Future used the opening track to send what seemed to be subliminals at his longtime collaborator. “You a ni**a number one fan, dog/ Sneak dissin’, I don’t understand, dog/ Pillowtalkin’, actin’ like a fed, dog/ I don’t need another fake friend, dog/ Can’t be ’bout a h**, ’cause we sharin’, dog/ In your feelings, ni**a, why you playin’, dog?” he rapped.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Many fans believe that the What A Time To Be Alive duo is at odds over a <a href=#>woman named Princess Diana</a>, evident in the title of the record “Magic Don Juan (Princess Diana).” She recently denied those claims.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Fans also resurfaced rumors N.O.R.E shared on The Breakfast Club last year, saying that the Atlanta rapper wasn’t happy that the part-time crooner did the collaborative album Her Loss with 21 Savage. Whatever the case may be, the fans who think a civil war is brewing in Hip-Hop may be on to something.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m%2ForfEZpurp6Coeqq60q2YoKqRonqxu9KtZJ%2BZnqh6uK3IraCnn12gsq%2Bw0aKapGWclrqivoydoKyrXWZ%2FdICXb2xpb2Vk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
