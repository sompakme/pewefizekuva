There are many teenagers who have been able to use their advanced knowledge in technology to create some impressive websites or apps that they have then sold on to become millionaires at a very young age.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was a time when some of the richest people in the world were in their mid-60s and 70s and their&nbsp;wealth was a reflection of a lifetime of work, but now there are many teenagers and children who have more money than a regular person will make in a lifetime.&nbsp;When it comes to some of the richest American's who are under the age of 25, it's interesting to note that many of them are still teenagers and have inherited much of their income. There are the select few who have been working in the public eye&nbsp;for decades to build up their net worth, while the rest of the people on the list have cashed in on a brilliant idea that has set them up for life.</p><p>The following list looks at 25 of the richest American's under the age of 25. Many of the names on this list are the stars that the public read about on a regular basis, but many were completely unaware that their income had been able to soar in the current climate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dannielynn-birkhead---59-million>Dannielynn Birkhead - $59 million</h2><p>Dannielynn Birkhead is the 11-year-old daughter of the late Anna Nicole Smith, much like her mother, Dannielynn has stepped into a career as a model and so far has been quite successful since her most notable campaign was back in 2013 when she posed as a face of Guess Girl’s Spring line.</p><p>Even though Dannielynn was named the sole heir of her mother's estate back in 2008, this was only worth around $10 million, which means that Birkhead has managed to amass an income of more than $49 million dollars from a lawsuit in her mother's name and from her own career in modeling in recent years.</p><h2 id=blue-ivy---1-billion>Blue Ivy - $1 billion</h2><p>Blue Ivy is a name that is recognized all over the world because of her famous parents, Beyonce and Jay Z. When she was still a baby Ivy's cries were heard on her father's "Glory" single but with a combined wealth of more than $1 billion, Ivy is obviously living a life that is very different to every other six year old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Recently Ivy was featured rapping on her father's new album and seems to have quite an impressive career ahead of her. Despite her parent's recent issues and the fact that she now has twin siblings, <a href=#>RankRed</a> reports that Blue Ivy remains the richest person in America under the age of 25.</p><h2 id=rowan-blanchard---3-million>Rowan Blanchard - $3 Million</h2><p>Rowan Blanchard is just 16 years old and her net worth has already reached seven figures. The actress started her career when she was nine years old in The Back Up Plan and later became an icon for her portrayal of Riley Matthews in Disney Series Girl Meets World.</p><p>While the actress hasn't made as much of an impact on the business as many other stars on this list. At the height of Girl Meets World fame, she signed a contract to be paid $10,000 an episode, which is why&nbsp;<a href=#>The Squander</a>&nbsp;now reports that the young star has a net worth of between $2 and $3.5 million and definitely has a bright future ahead of her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=quvenzhan-wallis---3-million>Quvenzhané Wallis - $3 Million</h2><p>The young actress is a self-made millionaire and at just 14 years old, this is quite the achievement.&nbsp;Quvenzhané Wallis is the daughter of a truck driver and who made her acting debut when she was just nine years old in Beasts of the Southern Wild.</p><p>This film made her a star overnight and she later became the youngest actress to ever be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress and the first person to be born in the 21st century and nominated for an Oscar. The star who is also known for Annie and 12 Years a Slave now has a reported net worth of $3 million, which makes her annual income around $460,000.</p><h2 id=jackie-evancho---4-million>Jackie Evancho - $4 Million</h2><p>Jackie Evancho may only be 18 years old, but she gained worldwide recognition from an early age&nbsp;back in 2009 when she auditioned for&nbsp;America's Got Talent. The singer has since released seven albums over the past decade and became&nbsp;the youngest solo artist ever to go platinum in the U.S. in 2011, with her first full-length album, Dream with Me.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jackie's life in the spotlight has allowed her to amass a net worth of more than $4 million, according to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a> before she is even able to spend it, which is quite an achievement for someone as young as Jackie in the music industry.</p><h2 id=bella-thorne---4-million>Bella Thorne - $4 Million</h2><p>Bella Thorne has become a household name over the past few years ever since she left Disney Channel behind and has starred in The Duff and Midnight Sun. The singer turned actress rose to fame when she was just 13 years old as part of Shake It Up alongside Zandaya but has since been able to&nbsp;gain an income of around $4 million, according to <a href=#>Celebs Net Worth Today</a>.</p><p>Thorne is just 20 years old, but she seems to have been around for much younger than seven years since alongside her acting career she has also been able to release a number of singles and is a&nbsp;talented musician as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=willow-smith---4-million>Willow Smith - $4 Million</h2><p>The only daughter of Will Smith and Jada Pinkett has been in the spotlight for most of her life but hasn't been as proactive as her brother in the acting business, which could be why her net worth is much lower than Jaden's. Willow seemed to be concentrating more on a career in music when she was younger since she released "Whip My Hair" when she was just nine years old.</p><p>Willow is now 17 and has a net worth that is estimated to be around $4 million. This is a total that the star has created for herself rather than being one of the children on the list who have inherited their wealth from their parents.</p><h2 id=rico-rodriguez---4-million>Rico Rodriguez - $4 Million</h2><p>Rico Rodriguez is perhaps best known for his role as&nbsp;Manny Delgado in Modern Family, a role that he has portrayed since he was 12 years old. The actor has&nbsp;won the&nbsp;Screen Actors Guild Award twice, in 2011 and 2012 and has been able to branch out into a number of other projects as his fame has grown.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At just 19 years old, Rico has a net worth of $9 million despite only being in the spotlight for around a decade and continues to appear in some of the most popular TV shows while remaining a main cast member on Modern Family.</p><h2 id=elle-fanning---5-million>Elle Fanning - $5 Million</h2><p>Elle Fanning is the younger sister of well-known actress Dakota and not only has she followed her sister into the acting business but she has already been able to become one of the richest teenagers in America right now with a net worth of around $5 million. According to <a href=#>Vogue</a>, Elle's first acting job actually came alongside her sister in Taken, where she played the younger version of Dakota.</p><p>Since 2001, she has appeared in more than 30 television shows and movies, mostly as a guest star, but she didn't achieve millionaire status until 2015 but at just 19 years old the star has many more years ahead of her in the acting industry.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zendaya---5-million>Zendaya - $5 Million</h2><p>Zendaya got her big break on Disney Channel show Shake It Up when she was still just a teenager, but much like Bella Thorne she has been able to break away from that image in recent years and even landed a prominent role in musical biopic&nbsp;The Greatest Showman, alongside Hugh Jackman and Zac Efron, which is said to be one of the biggest films of the year.</p><p>The singer, dancer, and actress is still just 20 years old, but she is now considered to be a global star and one of the richest millennials in America with a net worth estimated to be around $5 million.</p><h2 id=jaden-smith---8-million>Jaden Smith - $8 million</h2><p>Jaden Smith ranks much higher on this list than his younger sister Willow because he has created quite an acting resume in recent years after appearing alongside his father in films such as In The Pursuit of Happyness and After Earth after making his acting debut when he was just eight years old.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jaden is just 19 years old but has only appeared in six movies, all of which have become blockbusters&nbsp;and has even pushed himself into a career as a rapper, which could explain his $8 million net worth. It appears that all of Will and Jada's children are doing well for themselves in their chosen industry.</p><h2 id=the-gates-children---10-million-each>The Gates Children - $10 million each</h2><p>Bill Gates is known for his philanthropy, but despite supporting a number of charitable causes over the past few years, the founder of Microsoft has reiterated a number of times that his children will gain a portion of his wealth as well. Gates has always wanted his children to have normal lives and work towards their own fortunes, which is why his four children will only receive around $10 million each of his $92.8 billion fortune.</p><p>Gates oldest daughter Jennifer is now 21, while his younger children could be seen as some of the richest children in America knowing that they are already millionaires.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ryan---11-million>Ryan - $11 million</h2><p>Ryan is just six years old, but it's reported by&nbsp;<a href=#>Business Insider</a>&nbsp;that his YouTube Channel, Ryan ToysReview, made more than $11 million in pretax income last year. The YouTube Channel began back in March 2015 when Ryan was just four years old and he asked his parents if he could make a review video about some of his toys.</p><p>The channel has since grown to the point where there are now more than 10 million subscribers, which translates to more than $1 million a month from revenue of ads alone. Forbes ranked Ryan eighth on their list of highest-earning YouTube celebrities in 2018.</p><h2 id=chloe-grace-moretz---12-million>Chloe Grace Moretz - $12 million</h2><p>Chloe Grace Moretz is just 21 years old, but over the past 14 years she has been a consistent face in the acting world and has appeared in a number of high-grossing movies. Moretz landed her first acting role when she was just seven years old and she has since appeared in almost 50 different movies. This could be why she has been able to&nbsp;gather an estimated net worth of around $12 million at such a young age, something that is expected to grow since Chloe doesn't look to be taking a break anytime soon.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=valentina-paloma-pinault---12-million>Valentina Paloma Pinault - $12 million</h2><p>Many readers may be unfamiliar with the name&nbsp;Valentina Paloma Pinault, but the 10-year-old is the daughter of actress Salma Hayek and her billionaire CEO husband François-Henri Pinault. The young star is kept out of the public eye, but it is expected that she will inherit around $12 million when she turns 18 years old.</p><p>Valentina hasn't been pushed into a career like many other children of actresses or singers, instead, the family has allowed their only daughter to live a normal life and only share rare photos of her on Instagram, where she looks to be the spitting image of her famous mother.</p><h2 id=gigi-hadid---13-million>Gigi Hadid - $13 million</h2><p>Gigi Hadid may only be 23 years old, but the star has been in the spotlight since she was two years old and began to model as a baby. Hadid signed with IMG models back in 2013 and was then named model of the year in 2015.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The model has been linked to former One Direction member Zayn Malik over the past few years, which has made her spotlight much brighter, but the couple announced their split back in March. Hadid has an estimated net worth of around $13 million and is a self-made millionaire but had some help entering the business from her mother Yolanda Hadid, who is also a former model.</p><h2 id=dakota-fanning---16-million>Dakota Fanning - $16 Million</h2><p>Elle Fanning made the list much earlier, but her sister Dakota has been in the acting business ever since she was five years old and is now one of the most recognizable actresses in the world. Dakota has starred in I Am Sam, Man On Fire and War of The Worlds as well as the Twilight series, and throughout the course of her career, she has created a net worth of $16 million.</p><p>At 24 years old Dakota is showing no signs of slowing down either with more movies in post-production to follow her recent performance in Oceans 8, which received mixed reviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=abigail-breslin---16-million>Abigail Breslin - $16 million</h2><p>Abigail Breslin began her acting career at just three years old when she started appearing in adverts and has since moved her way up to becoming one of the best-known actresses in the world. Breslin's breakthrough role came back in 2006 when she was just 10 years old and landed the main role in Little Miss Sunshine.</p><p>Breslin has been a present face in the acting world over the past decade, so it comes as no surprise that she has already gathered quite an impressive net worth. Breslin is just 22 years old and already has an estimated net worth of around $16 million which, according to <a href=#>Article Bio</a>, ranks her inside the top ten of the richest young actresses in 2018.</p><h2 id=kendall-jenner---18-million>Kendall Jenner - $18 million</h2><p>Kendall Jenner was signed to&nbsp;Wilhelmina Models when she was just 14 years old, which was two years after she first started appearing on Keeping Up With The Kardashians and has since appeared on many of the spin-off reality shows that have been made surrounding her family.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenner is the oldest daughter of Bruce Jenner and Kris Kardashian and is the half-sister of the Kardashian daughters Kim, Khloe, and Kourtney. Kendall may only be 22 years old, but she has already been able to create a net worth of $18 million, which is proof that her eight-year modelling career has been fruitful so far.</p><h2 id=harper-and-gideon---18-million>Harper and Gideon - $18 million</h2><p>Harper and Gideon are the adorable six year old twins of Neil Patrick Harris and&nbsp;David Burtka. Even though the&nbsp;two are kept out of the spotlight they are still expected to inherit around $18 million of their parent's fortune even though they are not old enough to understand how rich they actually are.&nbsp;</p><p>Patrick Harris is perhaps best known for his role as Barney Stinson on How I Met Your Mother while his husband David Burtka is also an actor and a professional chef. Combined the couple have a net worth of almost $40 million, which means that their children are set to inherit a small fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=knox-amp-vivienne-jolie-pitt---67-5-million>Knox & Vivienne Jolie Pitt - $67.5 Million</h2><p>Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have adopted a number of children over the course of their relationship, which ended back in 2017 but it's reported that Knox and Vivienne are the two children who will inherit the most financially from their parents.</p><p>It is believed that Jolie and Pitt have a combined income of around $400 million, which means that their children will inherit almost $70 million from their parents in the coming years. Knox and Vivienne also have four siblings called Maddox, Pax,&nbsp;Shiloh, and Zahara but it was the twins birth back in 2008 that sent the media into a frenzy and the first images of the babies became the most expensive pictures ever sold at&nbsp;$14 million.</p><h2 id=axl-duhamel--45-million>Axl Duhamel- $45 million</h2><p>Axl is the four year old son of Fergie and her ex-husband Josh Duhamel. The adorable youngster is the only child of the two stars who divorced back in 2017 and combined it is reported that his parents are worth an incredible $60 million, which could be why Ohfabuloso estimate that Axl himself could be worth around $45 million himself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At just four years old, Axel is one of the youngest stars on this list, but also one of the richest because of the work that his parents have put in over the past few years, which is interesting even though he won't be needing any of this money for a number of years.</p><h2 id=liva-veda-and-livingston---79-million>Liva, Veda, and Livingston - $79 million</h2><p>The three children of Camila and Matthew McConaughey may all be under the age of 10, but they have still been able to make their way on to this list since their parents have amassed a small fortune, which will allow them to gain a share of almost $100 million when the time is right.</p><p>Combined Matthew and his wife Camila are currently worth an impressive $100 million and both stars have projects coming up, which means that in the coming years their net worth will continue to grow and their children will continue to be seen as some of the richest children in the world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner---50-million>Kylie Jenner - $50 Million</h2><p>Kylie Jenner is the youngest of the Kardashian/Jenner family but at just 20 years old she is already considered to be a reality television personality, model, entrepreneur, socialite, and social media personality. Jenner has appeared on many of her family's reality TV shows and has also been able to pursue a number of her own business ventures, which is why her estimated net worth is much higher than her sister Kendalls.</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=#>Time,</a> Kylie's net worth is estimated to be around $50 million and much of this wealth has come&nbsp;from her quick-selling make-up line, which she called Kylie Cosmetics.</p><h2 id=rose-dorothy-dauriac---56-million>Rose Dorothy Dauriac - $56 million</h2><p>Rose Dauriac is the only child of actress Scarlett Johansson and her ex-husband&nbsp;Romain Dauriac.
