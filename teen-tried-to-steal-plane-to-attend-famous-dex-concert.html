His intention was to apparently fly to Illinois for the concert. Airport security called police after they spotted him jumping the fence at around 2:30 a.m. local time. Scott was found seated the pilot’s seat in cockpit. He has no pilot training but told authorities that he assumed it would be pretty simple to fly the aircraft. Two of the officers reportedly recognized Scott from previous run-ins.</p><p>Scott initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, last August. His public defender asked the court to provide a mental evaluation, which found that Scott was competent enough to stand trial and understood the charges against him.</p><p>In addition to probation, Scott was ordered to pay a $1,000 fine in addition to court costs. He is also required to receive treatment for mental health.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5a%2FrK3NrJisZaSasq95z6umm5mknryvedKtpqWdnmK9ra3NnmSfmZ2kwrR5w56vZpufo7CmvtNmbWxqZW6EcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
