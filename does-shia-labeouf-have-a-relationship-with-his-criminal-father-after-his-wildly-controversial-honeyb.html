Back then, LaBeouf was often in the company of his dad, Jeffrey Craig LaBeouf. However, as it would later come to light, <a href=#>the Disney alum's relationship with his dad was far from smooth sailing</a>.</p><p>Decades after Even Stevens closed its final chapter, LaBeouf, through his 2019 autobiographical film Honey Boy, dropped some shockingly dark truths about his relationship with his dad.</p><p><a href=#>The film, which premiered to overwhelming critical acclaim</a>, depicted Jeffrey Craig as a hardcore drug addict with a penchant for tough love.

However, as LaBeouf's career continued to skyrocket, their relationship spiraled even further into dysfunction.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Shia LaBeouf's Post Disney Career Was More Successful Than His Co-Star Sister's, Christy Carlson Romano</a></span></p><p>“We have an unspoken agreement, a secret,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the Nymphomaniac star told Interview Magazine of his relationship with his dad in 2014</a>. “We can't really tell each other that we're manipulating each other, but we both know it. And I love my dad. I'd love to be closer to my dad. But we've got something going on between us that's really valuable to me right now, more valuable to me than having a father.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shia-labeouf-made-a-wildly-controversial-film-about-his-relationship-with-dad-jeffrey-labeouf>Shia LaBeouf Made A Wildly Controversial Film About His Relationship With Dad, Jeffrey LaBeouf</h2><p>It’s no secret that, like his dad, Shia LaBeouf has had his fair share of run-ins with the law. However, none of the Wall Street star’s many brushes with justice benefited his career quite like his 2017 arrest for public intoxication in Georgia.</p><p>During the court-ordered rehab stint that followed, LaBeouf conjured up one of the highest-rated films of his career: Honey Boy. In the film, LaBeouf portrays James Lort, a manic-aggressive drug addict unmistakably inspired by the notorious Jeffrey Craig LaBeouf.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shia-labeouf-honey-boy.jpg><p>However, about three years after the film’s debut, LaBeouf admitted that he’d exaggerated some aspects of his relationship with his dad to fit his preferred narrative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I wrote this narrative, which was just f***ing nonsense,” he admitted on Jon Bernthal’s Real One’s podcast. “My dad was so loving to me my whole life. Fractured, sure. Crooked, sure. Wonky, for sure. But never was not loving, never was not there. He was always there.”</p><p>The acclaimed actor went on to admit that his dad was never nearly as abusive as he came off in the film. “I turned the knob up on certain s*** that wasn’t real,” he said. “My dad never hit me, never. He spanked me once, one time. And the story that gets painted in Honey Boy is this dude is abusing his kid all the time.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf Makes Creepy Comments About Falling In Love With Every Female Co-Star He Works With</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their longstanding strained relationship, LaBeouf regretted painting such a grim and unseemly picture of his dad. "Here's a man who I've done vilified on a grand scale," he said. "I put all his s**t in the street and used him…as like, 'This is the reason why I'm f***ing foul out here. I come from this wayward upbringing. My dad is the reason I'm such a f**k up.

However, with the project’s production hinged on Jeffrey Craig's approval, Shia had to rely on some underhanded tactics to get the green light.</p><p>"I remember getting on the phone with him and him being like, 'You know, I never read this stuff in the script you sent.' Because I didn't put that s**t in there," he shared with Jon Bernthal’s Real One’s podcast. "I was bulls***ing him.

Jeffrey Craig even gushed about Shia in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2019 interview with Gen’s Aaron Gell</a>. “He's my honey boy, my money honey! You betcha. He's been a light in my life,” he said. “Shia can be a bada**. He has that ability. But he is the sweetest, kindest soul. He's a wonderful person who went through some s***.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqoaGRYrmirsSorJ9llpbBqbHRZqGenpansrp5wquYop9dp7KtrdOipqermJ69brTOp5yymp%2BueqWxz6KaraGfo3q0r8Cnm5qkXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
