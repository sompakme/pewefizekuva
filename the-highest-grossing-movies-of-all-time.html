Before the year 2000, there was just one movie that had a budget of more than $200 million, Titanic. Since then, 29 movies with budgets of $200 million or more have been made. Does it make sense to throw that kind of money at a single 2 hour movie? The answer is yes, it does!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Hollywood has never before enjoyed as big an audience as it does now. Hollywood films are screened all over the world, making it to screens everywhere, from Africa, to South America, to Australia, India, and China. The number of moviegoers keeps rising as well, both domestically and abroad, and a larger audience means a larger return for the industry. Adopting a combination of simpler storytelling and expensive effects, Hollywood has begun releasing films that are universally understandable, and the money has followed. Out of the top 50 highest grossing movies of all time, only a handful of movies were made and released prior to the year 2000. Only one movie, Titanic (1997), features on the list of the top ten highest grossing movies of all time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Simply put, Hollywood has been making a killing since the end of the Millennium. In fact, it’s almost a guarantee (though there are more and more exceptions) that if a movie with great special effects is made, it will provide a solid return to its producers. Consequently, producers don’t mind spending a bundle for a movie with great special effects.</p><p>Statistically, franchise movies have performed the best, with offerings from Marvel Studios, the Pirates of the Caribbean films, and the Harry Potter series doing particularly well, but single releases have proven to be hugely profitable too, best exemplified by films like Avatar, Titanic, and Alice in Wonderland.</p><p>This list is based only on box-office earnings. DVD sales, television broadcasting money, merchandise sales, and other forms of revenue have not been calculated for these figures. That said, this list of the ten highest grossing movies of all time, arranged by worldwide box office total, surely does not need the help.</p><h2 id=10-pirates-of-the-caribbean-dead-man-s-chest---1-07-billion>10.&nbsp;Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest - $1.07 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Just making the cut on the list of the movies with the biggest box office revenue is Dead Man’s Chest, the final movie in the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise. The movie was made with a budget of $225 million and was released in 2006. It pulled in $1.06 billion at the box office, about a hundred million more than its sequel, At World’s End. At World’s End is thought to be the most expensive movie ever made, with a budget of a staggering $300 million, making Dead Man’s Chest a much better investment for the studio.</p><p>The original Pirates of the Caribbean franchise starred <a title="Johnny Depp Net Worth" href=#>Johnny Depp</a>, <a title="Orlando Bloom Net Worth" href=#>Orlando Bloom</a>, and <a title="Keira Knightley Net Worth" href=#>Keira Knightley</a>.
