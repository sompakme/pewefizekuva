What might feel really good for one person, might not feel good to another. Getting with someone you are attracted to and figuring out how to turn them on is one of the hottest things about sex.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But then there are the people that are into some things that are different. I don't mean the different things that a lot of people are into, like maybe being spanked or tied up a little. These people are really, really into things that are different. Let's just say they have some really odd fetishes. And I mean odd: they might be into statues, stuffed animals, cars, giants, you know the weird stuff.</p><p>In fact some of these fetishes are even funny. I mean how are you supposed to act all turned on when you find out that your girl is into stuffed animals or farting? I mean no matter how you slice it, that is just weird, and not only just weird but kind of hilarious.</p><p>Some of these things are so bizarre that you would never admit to having one of these fetishes, especially publicly. Well, maybe if you got lucky enough to find someone else with the same fetish as you,&nbsp;but still, how would you know?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Here are&nbsp;11 Funny Sex Fetishes You Could&nbsp;Never Admit To&nbsp;Liking&nbsp;Publicly.</p><h2 id=11-macrophilia---turned-on-by-giants><strong>11. Macrophilia - Turned On By Giants</strong></h2><p>via https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com</p><p>Okay, so once again it is apparent that some people have some pretty serious issues. Macrophilia is a fascination with giants; well not just giants of course. Female giants. There are not too many women thinking about male giants, surprisingly this is almost always men, who are fantasizing about female giants dominating them. Well, all right then, whatever floats your boat. There are some men who enjoy being small and abused that hire tall women to dominate them in private sessions in an effort to turn this fantasy into reality.</p><p></p><h2 id=10-mechanophilia---attraction-to-machines><strong>10. Mechanophilia - Attraction To Machines</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All right, I guess it had to come down to cars at some point. I mean people love cars. But really? They love them this much? Mechanophilia is a paraphilia involving a sexual attraction to machines such as motorcycles, cars and trucks, helicopters and even airplanes. In some countries it is even considered a crime to have sex with a car. This is definitely one that you aren’t going to tell people about. One man, named Edward Smith admitted to “having sex” with over 100 cars. What does that even mean? Actually, now that I mention it, don’t tell me, I don’t want to know.</p><p></p><h2 id=9-plushophilia---turned-on-by-stuffed-animals><strong>9. Plushophilia - Turned On By Stuffed Animals</strong></h2><p>via pinterest.com</p><p>This one is funny in a cute way. Now you might think that being plushophilia is the same thing as a furry fetish, which is further down the list, but it is not the same. While a furry dresses up as a stuffed animal, a plushophile is turned on by stuffed animals. In fact most flurries are not turned on by stuffed animals at all. Got that? Yeah, we don't either. All we do get is that if one of these guys comes over for a sleepover, make sure your teddy bear is locked up...</p><p></p><h2 id=8-exophilia---turned-on-by-aliens><strong>8. Exophilia - Turned On By Aliens</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I know, I know, a lot of you out there are saying "turned on by aliens? So what? That is perfectly normal!'" Well maybe it is and maybe it isn't but yes an exophiliac is into aliens, as well as robots and other things of that nature. So basically these guys are turned on by things that look like women, but they aren't. Makes sense right? Although this fetish&nbsp;has been going on since the beginning of time,&nbsp;it's still pretty weird in an outrageous way considering no one has ever seen an alien, according to public record, of course.</p><p></p><h2 id=7-eproctophilia---turned-on-by-farting><strong>7. Eproctophilia - Turned On By Farting</strong></h2><p>via http://media1.break.com</p><p>According to Wikipedia, eproctophiles are said to spend an abnormal amount of time thinking about farting and flatulence and have recurring intense sexual urges and fantasies involving farting and flatulence. You're&nbsp;not mistaken. You read it right. These people are turned on by farts. Most are men. I mean most times farting can be a deal breaker in a relationship, especially if it is done by the woman. But not with these guys. If you're okay with this fetish, than it is your lucky day! Just let it rip! Your guy will love you for it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=6-dendrophilia---turned-on-by-trees><b>6. Dendrophilia - Turned On By Trees</b></h2><p>Sure. I mean why not? There are all sorts of trees out there. I mean you have a pretty good chance of getting lucky with one right? Just kidding. This is just plain messed up. Dendrophilia literally means "love of trees". The term may sometimes refer to a paraphilia in which people are sexually attracted to or sexually aroused by trees. So if you happen to look outside and see your best friend in your backyard making out with your birch tree you don’t have to wonder what is going on anymore. Okay, actually you still do. Turned on by trees? What?</p><p></p><h2 id=5-agalmatophilia---turned-on-by-statues><strong>5. Agalmatophilia - Turned On By Statues</strong></h2><p>Surprisingly this is one of the more popular ones. Agalmatophilia is a paraphilia involving sexual attraction to a statue, doll, mannequin or other similar figurative objects. Sometimes the person&nbsp;gets turned on by the thought of having sex with a statue itself, but more often it is that they&nbsp;want to turn their partner&nbsp;into a statue. This fetish is&nbsp;a lot easier to carry out than a lot of the others ones on this list, but it is odd and kind of funny nonetheless. I suppose the objects of desire, much like a sex doll, never talk back.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=4-kleptolagnia---getting-turned-on-by-stealing><strong>4. Kleptolagnia - Getting Turned On By Stealing</strong></h2><p>You probably guessed because kleptolagnia sounds so similar to kleptomania, but this one is about getting turned on by stealing. This is a rather unfortunate one to have. Most of the fetishes on this list are just kind of embarrassing, but&nbsp;this one in particular could land you in jail. Most women don’t like it when you are going through their wallet while you are having sex with them. At least none I have met anyway. The guy with this condition might not have a hard time getting dates, but I bet he has a hard time keeping them around.</p><p></p><h2 id=3-knismolagnia---turned-on-by-tickling>&nbsp;<strong>3. Knismolagnia - Turned On By Tickling</strong></h2><p>Well this could come in handy. All over the world, right as we speak there are men chasing women around, trying to tickle them. And all over the world there are women pretending they don’t mind for a little while, then getting freaked out and scared. Then the fights start. But wait! There are people out there that get turned on by tickling and by being tickled! Someone should make some sort of chat room to get the people that like tickling and that like being tickled together! Actually now that I think of it, I am sure someone has done that already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p></p><h2 id=2-podophilia---turned-on-by-feet><strong>2. Podophilia - Turned On By Feet</strong></h2><p>This is the only one on the list that some people will admit to in private. Podophilia is more commonly known as a foot fetish, and although that is still considered weird, and grosses a lot of people out, it isn’t that&nbsp;odd that a man or woman will be into feet. The other odd thing about feet is that some feet actually are more attractive than others. If you don’t believe me just take a look around; there are some really ugly feet out there. Even though this one is more common than others on this list and isn’t quite as embarrassing, odds are you are still going to keep this to yourself, and yes if we catch you, we will make fun of you.</p><h2 id=1-furries---turned-on-by-other-furries><b>1</b>.&nbsp;<strong>Furries - Turned On By Other Furries</strong></h2><p>via http://www.paragraphline.com</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>I know, I know. Every other one of these fetishes has a fancy name and then we get to the end and it is just “Furries.” Well don’t blame me. These guys are a real thing and they deserve to be number one on this or any other list about hilarious fetishes. Furries are people that like dressing up by wearing what resembles cartoon animal costumes. Not all furries are into sex, some of them just like dressing up, which is embarrassing and funny all on its own. But a significant number actually are into being a furry because of having sex with another furry. There are all sorts of x-rated videos out now featuring furries, which is why furries is number one&nbsp;on our list.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong><a href=#>https://en.wikipedia.org</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZmppXZvCr7rYZqqesF2bsrW10qGcrGWppMJur86uo51lnprDpr6MmpumoaRiwbB5y6KioqaXYr22rsuimqWxXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
