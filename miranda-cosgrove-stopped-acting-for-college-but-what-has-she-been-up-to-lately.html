"I feel like I'm not the kind of person that would just go up to somebody and introduce myself, so it's helped me in a lot of ways.”</p><p>Taking the opportunity to attend college was important for Cosgrove, who explained that dedicating several years of her life to a course she felt passionate about helped her understand what she wanted to do later on in her career.</p><p>It also <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">taught her a lot about self-discipline</a>.</p><p>"College really does help you grow up and figure out who you are. So, it's just helped me grow as a person, like even just getting to classes on time and figuring out where classes are.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cosgrove returned to work on the horror-mystery The Intruders in 2015, starring Hudgen’s ex-boyfriend Austin Butler, but the movie was anything but a box office hit, with critics calling it the motion picture predictable and unoriginal.</p><p>In 2016, however, it appeared as if the former Nickelodeon star’s career was back on track when she landed a recurring role as Shea Moore in the short-lived NBC series Crowded.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Broadway, Nickelodeon & More: What Ariana Grande Did Before Becoming A Pop Star</a></span></p><p>The TV show looked promising and certainly had potential, but for reasons concerning its lackluster ratings, the network decided not to order a follow-up season, consequently leaving Cosgrove to find new acting gigs in Hollywood.</p><p>The following year, she starred in Despicable Me 3 where she played Margo. The family flick has been Cosgrove’s biggest film in well over a decade, having grossed a whopping $1 billion at the box office, with a fourth installment already said to be in development.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s unclear whether Cosgrove will return for another film in the popular franchise.</p><p>The Leave It All To Me singer went on to appear in several TV movies before landing her next motion picture in 2019, titled 3022. It was another low-budget film with not-so-positive reviews, making it evident that Cosgrove was either booking the wrong jobs or she was simply having a harder time landing the right roles.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans Believe Britney Spears’ Profile Picture On IG Is ‘Proof’ She’s Crying Out For Freedom</a></span></p><p>Her career slowing down over the years could also be due to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the scary 2011 bus crash that the pop star was involved in</a> while promoting her debut album on Dancing Crazy Tour. Cosgrove’s driver struck a disabled tractor-trailer in Illinois while she and her mother were inside the tour bus.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She lost $400,000 in revenue from what she would have made before having to cancel the remaining 25 dates while Sony Music was alleged to have “axed her from their books following the incident,” according to Daily Mail.</p><p>The incident was so bad, Cosgrove remained in a wheelchair for months while losing out on an additional $560,000 in additional income, which consequently resulted in her to sue for over $2.5 million in damages.</p><p>And while we may not hear much from Cosgrove these days, she’s still managed to amass an impressive fortune worth $10 million, so it doesn’t look as if this California girl will be running out of money anytime soon.</p><p>She doesn't have any other projects in the pipeline, according to IMDb, so fans will have to see what's next in store for the former Drake & Josh&nbsp;star.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears’ Boyfriend Sam Asghari Posts About Returning To Manchester, Is He Done With The Drama?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGikoqqRo7GiecKoqqCqn6uybr%2FTqKepnZRirqTAyKeeZp6fp3qku8ulnKCdXZfCtXnWoZitZZiWwG6%2Fx55km52Vo3q2vIytpmakkamyrcWO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
