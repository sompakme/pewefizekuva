Check out these 10 men who are the richest rock stars of 2019.</p><h2 id=gene-simmons>Gene Simmons</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trendrr</a>, the 10th&nbsp;richest rock star of 2019 is Gene Simmons, one of the lead vocalists of the band KISS. You might not recognize him without his iconic face makeup, but you’d definitely know him as “The Demon” from the band! It is estimated that he is worth around $300 million.</p><p>Simmons was born in Israel before emigrating to the United States. Quite interestingly for a rock star, he is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">anti-drugs and alcohol</a>. He always refrained from those kinds of activities to avoid hurting his mother, who had already survived the Holocaust.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dave-matthews>Dave Matthews</h2><p>South African-born <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dave Matthews</a> isn’t as popular as some of the other rock stars on this list, but that doesn’t mean he isn’t one of the highest-paid in the industry. The frontman of the Dave Matthews Band is also worth around 300 million.</p><p>Playing guitar and piano as well as providing lead vocals, Matthews was clearly blessed with a lot of natural talent. He has been building his career since 1991 and, together with the band, established the Bama Works Fund in 1998, which has raised more than $40 million for humanitarian endeavors.</p><h2 id=keith-richards>Keith Richards</h2><p>One of the most famous guitarists of all time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Keith Richards</a> is another of the world’s wealthiest rock stars for 2019. Worth 340 million, he rose to prominence as part of the British band <a href=#>The Rolling Stones</a>. Richards co-founded the band,&nbsp;plays guitar, offers secondary vocals, and is also the co-principal songwriter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Johnny Depp</a> actually used Keith Richards as part of his inspiration for his famous <a href=#>Pirates of the Caribbean </a>character Captain Jack Sparrow. It made sense then that Richards joined the franchise later as Sparrow’s father, Captain Teague.</p><h2 id=bruce-springsteen>Bruce Springsteen</h2><p>Bruce Springsteen’s exact net worth is a matter of debate. While Trendrr cites it as $350 million, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">other sources</a> claim he’s worth $500 million. Either way, the <a href=#>lead singer</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;the E Street Band definitely deserves a spot on the list of richest rock stars of 2019.</p><p>Now in his 70s, Springsteen is still touring and delivering performances for thousands of hardcore fans all around the world. He’s showing no signs of slowing down and still has as much energy as he ever did. It’s easy to see why they call him The Boss!</p><h2 id=ringo-starr>Ringo Starr</h2><p>Though the world lost John Lennon and George Harrison, two members of the world-famous Beatles still live on. One is drummer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ringo Starr</a>, who has a net worth of $350 million, according to Trendrr. After performing with other bands, Starr joined the Beatles in 1962, which turned out to be a wise move.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After the breakup of the <a href=#>Beatles</a>, Starr went on to release his own music, which also ended up being seriously successful both at home in the U.K. and around the world. His solo career plus his time with the Beatles earned him two inductions into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The 10 Richest Pop Singers Of 2019</a></span></p><h2 id=mick-jagger>Mick Jagger</h2><p>It looks like Keith Richards isn’t the only Rolling Stone to become one of the richest rock stars of 2019. Mick Jagger, the lead vocalist of the British band, is worth $360 million, according to Trendrr. One of the most influential figures in rock and roll history, Jagger is another artist with a career spanning longer than 50 years who is still delivering music and performances to his fans.</p><p>Along with being one of the world’s most successful rock stars, Mick Jagger is also a father to eight children, five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sir-elton-john>Sir Elton John</h2><p>Few people recognize the name Reginald Kenneth Dwight, but you’d be hard-pressed to find somebody who doesn’t know of Dwight’s more famous moniker: Elton John. Having sold more than 300 million records during his expansive career, John is another one of the world’s richest rock stars, with an estimated net worth of about $480 million.</p><p>As well as performing his own music, John has also served as a songwriter for other artists and has written songs for films and theatrical productions, including <a href=#>The Lion King</a>&nbsp;and Billy Elliot the Musical.</p><h2 id=jimmy-buffet>Jimmy Buffet</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy Buffet</a> is more than a talented singer and songwriter. He is also an author and businessman, who has worked hard to earn his net worth of $550 million and become one of the richest rock stars in the world. Buffet is best-known for songs such as 'Margaritaville’ and ‘Come Monday’ which make fans feel like they’ve landed on a desert island oasis.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Buffet is also involved in two restaurant chains: the Margaritaville café and the Cheeseburger in Paradise. He has been a best-seller on the New York Times’ fiction and non-fiction list.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Richest Game Show Hosts Of All Time</a></span></p><h2 id=bono>Bono</h2><p>With a net worth that is estimated to be between $600 and $700 million, Bono is one of the richest rock stars of the age. He fronts the Irish <a href=#>rock band U2</a>, who are still touring and have been active since the 1970s. Recently, Bono has garnered attention for his humanitarian efforts and has made a name for himself as an activist and philanthropist.</p><p>Known as something of a rebel in his early years, Bono has gotten himself into trouble on occasion for his outspoken views on politics. But today he remains one of the world’s most loved and respected rock stars.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=paul-mccartney>Paul McCartney</h2><p>The richest rock star of 2019 is Paul McCartney, the former Beatle. With a net worth of $1.2 billion, he is one of the most successful rock stars not just of 2019, but of all time. Providing co-lead vocals and bass guitar for the group, McCartney rose to global fame through the Beatles and then went on to release other music after the band broke up. Today, he still performs shows for his fans (and <a href=#>they're kind of expensive</a>).</p><p>Like Bono, McCartney is a philanthropist&nbsp;and is especially interested in helping charities involved with animal rights, land mines, poverty, music education, and vegetarianism.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Every Cast Member Of Sex And The City's Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fqq%2FHnqqtZaKksKx50q2Yq6tdZ31yhY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
