The parties disagreed with the amount he would be paid, leading to the fight that bystanders recorded on their phones.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Although prosecutors dismissed the initial <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234704775>criminal battery charge</a> against the “Rockstar” rapper, the 30-year-old was still subjected to pay $6,000,000 in court fees, <a href=# rel=nofollow>TMZ</a> reports. On Monday the case was settled in DaBaby’s favor.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Baby’s legal representation,&nbsp;Drew Findling,&nbsp;shared with&nbsp;the outlet: “Along with our client, Jonathan Kirk (DaBaby), we are thrilled that this federal jury, after a five-day trial, came to the same conclusion that we have maintained for almost 3 years – that these plaintiffs were attempting to use the legal system to shake down Mr. Kirk.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rapper-dababy-arrives-for-the-premiere-of-apple-original-news-photo/1245259614?phrase=dababy%20&adppopup=true</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He added, “Mr. Kirk deserves all the credit in the world for not caving in to these plaintiffs’ cash demands and having the confidence in the facts and his legal team to take this to a jury trial for a complete and total victory!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Suge” artist also has another lawsuit pending over his aforementioned 2020 smash-hit “Rockstar.” DaBaby was hit with the case this month by Florida producer JuJu Beatz who claimed DaBaby’s team took elements of his original beat, “Selena” to produce “Rockstar.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to <a href=#>RollingStone</a>, JuJu Beatz said that he hasn’t <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234643773>received any compensation</a> for the “unauthorized” use of musical composition. He also stated that he’s tried to settle the matter outside of litigation with “numerous attempts,” but has been unsuccessful, causing him to take it to court.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As of now, there are no other updates pertaining to this suit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5muo63BsmSwoZ6oenN8kWlkpqGRorZurtGarqVlk5bApnmQa2ptb2JlhXKDjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
