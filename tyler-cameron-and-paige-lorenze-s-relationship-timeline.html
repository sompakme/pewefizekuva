Nearly one year after his split from <a href=#><strong>Camila Kendra</strong></a>, Bachelorette alum <a href=#><strong>Tyler Cameron</strong></a> moved on with model <a href=#><strong>Paige Lorenze</strong></a>.</p><p>“They’re dating. It’s still new,” a source told Us Weekly about the couple in July 2022. “They are keeping it on the down-low.”</p><p>Days after <a href=#>news of their romance first broke</a>, the pair were spotted packing on the PDA during a walk around New York City in photos obtained by <a href=#>Page Six</a>. Lorenze appeared to confirm their relationship via TikTok when she shared <a href=#>a video of the Florida native helping her cook dinner</a> in his apartment.</p><p>“Everyone here for the launch but just here to ask why you used a glass to make your dressing,” one TikTok user commented on the clip, to which the Dairy Boy founder responded, “Away game, <a href=#>cooking in a man’s apartment</a>. [I’ve] gotta improvise lol.”</p><p>However, the pair’s <a href=#>whirlwind romance</a> soon ended. “We just had to take a step back,” Cameron said during an August 2022 episode of E! News’ Daily Pop, confirming his split from Lorenze. “It wasn’t the right timing … We’re back [to], you know, not dating anymore, just doing our own thing right now. We both have a bunch of respect and love for each other but just not the right time for both of us right now.”</p><p>Cameron, who rose to fame as one of <strong><a href=#>Hannah Brown</a>‘</strong>s final two suitors on season 15 of <a href=#>The Bachelorette</a>, made headlines in summer 2019 when <a href=#>he was linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong> </a>shortly after <a href=#>he and the Alabama native nearly rekindled their romance off screen</a>. Both relationships soon fizzled out and <a href=#>the ABC Food Tours cofounder moved on with model Kendra</a>, whom he met on Instagram in January 2021.</p><p>“She asked me if I was from L.A., I was like, ‘No, I’m Florida,’ and she’s like, ‘I’m in Florida.’ She was an hour away, we met and that’s how it happened,” Cameron gushed during a July 2021 appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen, adding that he was “very in love” with Kendra. “We went to a restaurant, and we sat there, we just talked for hours. We couldn’t even look at the menu, so I just told them, like, ‘Bring whatever.’ We just talked, hung out. We sat there for four hours. I had a great night.”</p><p>Just one month later, though, <a href=#>Us confirmed that the pair called it quits</a>. “Things were going well until they weren’t,” a source told Us exclusively at the time. “Friends were surprised things ended so quickly.”</p><p>In the wake of their split, Cameron confessed that he was <a href=#>planning to change his approach to finding love</a> after his high-profile romances. “Slow down! [On] The Bachelorette, <a href=#>you grow so fast in that relationship, like, you have to</a>. And I think it kind of pushed me and my other relationships to kind of want to grow so fast and it’s OK to slow down and take a breath,” the Real Dirty Dancing alum exclusively told Us in February 2022. “[That’s] something I have to work on and get better at. But yeah, slow down for sure.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>That same month, <a href=#>Lorenze confirmed that she was dating</a> country star <a href=#><strong>Morgan Wallen</strong></a> with a PDA-filled social media post. “I love you and I’m so proud of you @morganwallen,” the former ski racer wrote via her Instagram Story at the time. The pair — who began dating in August 2021 — <a href=#>ultimately called it quits later that month</a>, with an insider telling Us at the time that Lorenze was the one who ended things.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see Cameron and Lorenze’s complete relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkwbq4xKtknJmdmr%2BwuoyapZ1loJa2qLGMpaarnZ6vsrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZK2hnZq5qrrEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
