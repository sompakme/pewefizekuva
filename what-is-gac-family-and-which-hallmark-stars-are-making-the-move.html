After conservative groups slammed the ad as not being “family-friendly,” Hallmark pulled it — and caused an uproar. Eventually, Abbott changed his tune and <a href=#>placed the clip back on the network</a>.</p><p>The backlash came after years of criticism about Hallmark Channel’s lack of diversity and LGBTQ+ story lines.</p><p>“I think that generalization isn’t fair, either, that we just have Christmas with white leads,” Abbott told The Hollywood Reporter in November 2020. “In terms of broadening out the demographic, it’s something we’re always thinking about, always considering and we’ll continue to make the movies where the best scripts are delivered to us and what we think have the most potential.”</p><p>The company was split into two brands — <a href=#>Great American Family and Great American Living</a>, both of which launched in September 2021.</p><p>Great American Family’s first original series was <a href=#>season 2 of When Hope Calls</a>, which included former Hallmark mainstay <a href=#><strong>Lori Loughlin</strong></a>’s return to TV. Season 1 aired on Hallmark Channel in 2019.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In October 2021, Great American Family announced “12 Movies of Christmas,” the network’s holiday celebration, which will feature an original Christmas movie each Saturday night. Following Thanksgiving weekend — which included three nights in a row of original holiday movies — new Christmas programming will air each Saturday and Sunday night throughout December as part of Great American Christmas, Great American Family’s franchise.</p><p>When the lineup was announced, many fans realized that some of <a href=#>Hallmark’s staple stars</a> are included — and some are making the move permanently over to Great American Family.
