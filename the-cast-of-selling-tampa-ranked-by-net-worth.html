While their clients have been known to be extremely wealthy, the realtors aren't doing bad for themselves at all. If they earn millions in commission from closing one transaction, we can only wonder how much money they actually have. Here are the richest cast members of the show.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Ladies Of 'Selling Sunset' Ranked From Oldest To Youngest</a></span></p><h2 id=sharelle-rosado---6-million><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Sharelle Rosado - $6 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>We can't say it's particularly surprising that Sharella Rosado, the CEO of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Allure Realty</a> is the wealthiest of the bunch. She's been in the real estate business for a while and launched her company in 2019. Currently, Allure Realty is globally recognized and stands as one of America’s top brokerages. Rosado is presently estimated to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $6 million, and just like the characters on the sister show, Selling Sunset, the drama with these rich folks never ends.</p><h2 id=rena-frazier---2-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Rena Frazier - $2 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the CEO has a net worth of close to eight figures, it can't be much of a surprise that her number two is closely behind. Of all the agents in Allure Realty, under Rosado’s supervision, Frazier is the most monied. Even though she has been a part of the company since its early days, she had a pretty outstanding career before it. She holds a law degree and practiced for over seven years before Allure, a time within which she was made a partner at the law firm. Joined with the money she made from her previous line of work, Frazier is currently estimated to have a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">net worth</a> of $2 million.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Fans Name Friendliest 'Selling Sunset' Star, And It's Not Chrishell Stause</a></span></p><h2 id=juawana-colbert---1-million><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Juawana Colbert - $1 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the many qualities that have kept Sharelle Rosado at the top of the food chain in her line of work is her ability to spot the best of the best and bring them in.
