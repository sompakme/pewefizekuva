Or the prequel, CW's The Carrie Diaries — slammed by SJP herself.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Starring AnnaSophia Robb, 27, as the young Carrie, the spinoff had a mere 2-season run from 2013 to 2014. The main reason it was canceled was a lack of viewership. Some have ruled it out as natural fate of most spinoffs. But others think the disapproval of the OG Carrie might have sabotaged it. But what exactly did SJP say about the show? And did the writer of the books, Sex and the City and The Carrie Diaries agree with her? Here's the whole dish...</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Why Kim Cattrall Initially Rejected Iconic Role As Samantha Jones In 'Sex And The City'</a></span></p><h2 id=annasophia-robb-39-s-thoughts-on-playing-young-carrie-bradshaw>AnnaSophia Robb's Thoughts On Playing Young Carrie Bradshaw</h2><p>Robb was 19 years old when she played the teenage Carrie — a 16-year-old recent high school graduate. "It's a dream come true," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told NY Daily News</a> in 2013. The young actress was confident and determined to bring her own take on the part. "I try to watch an episode each night," she continued. "It's to remind myself of the energy in the part, although I'm not trying to emulate SJP at all, that's not what anyone — Amy Harris (executive producer) or the studio — wants."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, that was no shade on SJP. The Bridge to Terabithia star even said that her adult Carrie "was a phenomenal, outstanding performance on its own." Robb clarified that she was "just trying to capture some of its essence and energy" in some "sort of a combination of her in the original show and me as her younger version."</p><p>The Soul Surfer actress also revealed that she had to adjust to a whole new lifestyle. Originally from Denver, she said that moving to New York had been a wild ride. "The paparazzi are not [great], but everything else has been amazing," she shared. "It definitely has been a transition — I don't think I've processed the whole thing, the move to New York, the show … I'm just sort of dazed and confused."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Willie Garson's Biggest Roles (Besides Sex And The City)</a></span></p><h2 id=sjp-isn-39-t-a-big-fan-of-39-carrie-diaries-39>SJP Isn't A Big Fan Of 'Carrie Diaries'</h2><p>During an interview with Net-a-Porter's The Edit, SJP admitted that it was "odd" that another actress was taking on her iconic role. "I’m not sure… You know, I think it’s one of those tests of your generosity," said the Hocus Pocus star. "She [Robb] is a lovely girl and I want her to feel good about it, but it’s… odd." There wasn't any rift between the two actresses. In fact, Robb said that Parker had sent her a "very lovely note kind of giving me her blessing and encouraging me and saying how dear the part was for her."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harris also confirmed Parker's support in the making of the spinoff. "She told me how unbelievably proud she is and how grateful that it's me that's carrying on the torch," the executive producer said of the SATC lead star. "She's been wonderfully magnanimous and it's been lovely and very scary for me because I take my responsibility very seriously." Harris was behind the coming-of-age idea for Carrie Diaries. She said that "for people who have never seen Sex and the City, this is just a really great coming age story about a girl becoming a woman."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>First Footage From 'Sex And The City' Reboot Is Rejected By Fans</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-writer-of-39-sex-and-the-city-39-defended-39-carrie-diaries-39>The Writer Of 'Sex And The City' Defended 'Carrie Diaries'</h2><p>Former New York Observer columnist, Candace Bushnell, 62, didn't agree with SJP's comments on the prequel. The SATC and Carrie Diaries author even encouraged fans to watch the CW show. "The reality is, that’s showbiz," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bushnell told The Daily Beast</a> in 2013. "Sarah Jessica’s first part was somebody else’s part. She played Annie on Broadway. She understands how these things work." The Daily Beast also wrote that the spinoff only had an average of 1.5 million viewers, leading to speculations that it wouldn't be renewed for season 2.</p><p>"Look, Sarah Jessica Parker is 47," Bushnell added. "I think with the second movie, Carrie Bradshaw couldn’t be an ingenue anymore. But I think they were stuck doing what the audience wanted." The writer also expressed her disapproval of a then-rumored part 3 in the SATC movie franchise. She explained: "Realistically, a middle-aged woman who was married without children would be much more focused on her career and less focused on this Mr. Big: 'Does he love me?' … 'Does he still not love me?'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I mean, I think it was coming to the end of what they could do with the character," she continued. In a recent interview, she said she wasn't bothered about Samantha Jones being gone in the upcoming sequel. She also plans on watching the limited series. But again, she acknowledged that "HBO’s going to make money on it" and that they're "going to exploit it as much as they can." Well, that's show business.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>'Sex And The City': Fans Fed Up with Sarah Jessica Parker's 'Toxic Relationship'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYsCivsChZKOdo6i2pK2MqZiro5WnerOxwKWjsmWknby2s8etZJqan6rBbsDHnmScmaKntqZ5w6KYq6GVqHqkrc2cnKWdlGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
