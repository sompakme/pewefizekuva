It has to as projects continue to get delayed and those in charge of others have to consider how that affects their own work. Could it mean going up against an MCU movie when that weekend was originally free of any major competition?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Speaking of Marvel, Sony's next chapter in its own cinematic universe was supposed to be Morbius. That will still be the case, but Marvel fans will now have to wait until March 2021 to see it. As for the most anticipated next step in what has become a universe focused on Marvel's villains, that was meant to be coming this October.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Leaked Footage Gives First Look At Woody Harrelson As Carnage In Venom 2</a></span></p><p>We are, of course, talking about Venom 2. A delay in production&nbsp;has halted the sequel from being released on schedule. Plus, Morbius having to be pushed back has had a similar sort of domino effect as Black Widow's delay had on the MCU. It was revealed this week that Venom 2 will now be released on June 5, 2021, ensuring it comes after Morbius.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>There was some&nbsp;good news to go with the bad. A teaser posted by Venom himself, <a href=#>Tom Hardy</a> revealed that Venom 2 now has a name. Venom: Let There Be Carnage. Carnage is a reference to the foe Hardy will come up against in the sequel, played by <a href=#>Woody Harrelson</a>. Fans who stayed for the credits of Venom will have been tipped off to that, as has become customary with superhero movies.</p><p>There was a point where we thought there might be a glut of movies all released at once for us to go binge at theaters when all this is over. As fun as that might be after not being able to go for months, it would have a terrible knock-on effect heading into 2021 and beyond. Best to push all of these dates and treat cinema's release schedule as if the last few months never happened.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Man Claims To Have Perfected KFC's Secret Recipe At Home</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e9WepailXWd6tbXTpZxmppWserOxy56YrJ1dma61sY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
