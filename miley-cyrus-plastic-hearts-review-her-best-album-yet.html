Sure, 2013’s Bangerz was a cultural reset. Yes, it gave us hit (“We Can’t Stop”) after hit (“Wrecking Ball”) after hit (“Adore You”). But this is the record that she was born to make.</p><p>Across 15 tracks, the singer, 28, embraces being utterly unapologetic and secures her place among rock royalty thanks to collaborations with the legendary <strong>Billy Idol</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Joan Jett</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Stevie Nicks</strong></a>. She also brings <a href=#><strong>Dua Lipa</strong></a> along for the ride of a lifetime with their badass, unintended quarantine anthem, “Prisoner.”</p><p>Much of the album is inspired by Cyrus’ divorce from <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a>. Right from the jump, she dives into <a href=#>their 2019 split</a> with “WTF Do I Know,” her most savage kiss-off since “7 Things” from 2008’s Breakout. “Am I wrong that I moved on, and I / And I don’t even miss you / Thought that it’d be you until I die / But I let go,” she sings over electric guitars and a stadium-rock beat.</p><p>As Plastic Hearts progresses, though, the Hannah Montana alum’s heartache morphs into self-reflection. On the vulnerable midtempo “Angels Like You,” she learns to let go and realizes that the relationship was not meant to be — even if everything looked A-OK from the outside looking in. “I know that you’re wrong for me / Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave,” she howls.</p><p>And on the gut-wrenching power ballad “Never Be Me,” Cyrus lists off all of the reasons she was not a quote-unquote good wife: “If you’re looking for stable / That’ll never be me / If you’re looking for faithful / That’ll never be me / If you’re looking for someone to be all that you need / That’ll never be me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Miley-Cyrus.jpg><p>Self-love also takes center stage on the album. During the raucous chorus of “Gimme What I Want,” the Grammy nominee vows to give herself the respect and appreciation she deserves if her partner fails to do so. The beautifully constructed <a href=#>disco-pop single “Midnight Sky,”</a> meanwhile, celebrates her free spirit with lyrics like, “I was born to run / I don’t belong to anyone, oh no / I don’t need to be loved by you.”</p><p>Cyrus carries the ‘80s glam-rock feel of “Midnight Sky” over to her and Idol’s stellar duet, “Night Crawling,” and pushes boundaries with her and Jett’s moan-filled thumper, “Bad Karma.” The most unexpectedly poignant moment, however, comes in the form of a song called “Golden G String,” which details the sexism that Cyrus has faced since the early days of her career. (<a href=#>2013 VMAs</a>, anyone?)</p><p>“I did it all to make you love me and to feel alive,” she croons. “Oh, that’s just the world we’re living in / The old boys hold all the cards, and they ain’t playing gin / You dare to call me crazy / Have you looked around this place? / I should walk away / But I think I’ll stay.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>And stay she shall.</p><p>3.5 stars (out of 4)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSipJWueqTF0a6qZqiclsC1tcJmn56ZoqnAbr7Er6Cer12dsrN5wZ6qrWWRoa%2B2uYyynK1n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
