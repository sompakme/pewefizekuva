The single-storied contemporary structure has seven bedrooms, with the main ivy-covered house lavishly sprawled across four bedrooms and six baths. The secluded LA mega-mansion comes with complete privacy and stunning views of the urban side of California, along with breathtaking scenes of the Franklin canyon in the backyard. Lush greenery, tranquil zen-style gardens, a crystal clear koi fish pond, and a cabana-style teak pool area make it a resort haven.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside HIMYM Star Alyson Hannigan’s $18 Million Encino home</a></span></p><p>The <i>Live with Kelly and Ryan</i> star bought this historic property from <a href=#>celebrated host and Emmy Award winner Ellen DeGeneres</a> in 2012 for $36.5 million. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor</a>, the abundant space was built in 1957 originally for actor Laurence Harvey. It was later bought by actress Joan Collins who sold it to Max Mutchnick, co-creator of the hit sitcom <i>Will & Grace</i>. While the producer occupied the house, he entrusted interior designer Melinda Ritz to expand the living space and add reclaimed-wood floors with high ceiling beams, thus changing the tone and ambiance of the property to a more refined classic taste.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-mega-mansion-s-indoor-and-outdoor-amenities>The Mega Mansion's Indoor And Outdoor Amenities</h2><p>Two of the five structures on the compound are exotic guest houses surrounded by thick greenery. The teak pool house comes with a covered lounge area with comfortable couches. A massage room with spa-like amenities for guests, a large pool with a cabana lounge, and outdoor pizza oven make it a paradise for entertaining family and friends. A sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of LA, the tranquil property offers stunning views of the California valley. The master bedroom opens into a private meditation garden with contemporary white statues and green shrubs. An ideal spot to spend relaxing after a hard day of work.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a><a href=#>, </a>the nook also has an al-fresco dining table for enjoying breakfast. The Walk-in closet is double the size of a two-bedroom; it is covered in brown/beige earthy tones. The suite boasts stunning backyard views and a sunny-lit bathroom with a skylight roof.</p><p>The rustic Scandinavian theme of white-washed walls and beamed high ceilings in the lavishly spread living room makes it large and inviting. A private bar setup for cocktail parties is equally tempting with the hardwood floors. The neutral-colored furniture complements the breezy interior and glass doors.</p><h2 id=additional-renovations-that-enhanced-the-property-s-value>Additional Renovations That Enhanced The Property's Value</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a>, the former <a href=#><i>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</i></a> producer made additional changes to the palatial property during his brief stay. An exotic massage room with modern spa amenities and a large media room with 20 seaters were modeled into the existing structure. These modern voguish features were instrumental in selling the mega-mansion at a whopping price of $51 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The massive kitchen comes with rustic high ceilings and marble countertops. A decadent gourmet meal for 20 can be arranged comfortably with sleek gadgets and appliances available. A 10-seater immaculately white dining table with contemporary light fixtures and eccentric artwork adorn the passage from the kitchen. The area also covers a tastefully decorated mini-living area with a quaint breakfast nook for quick meals.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, The main attraction of the property is the reflective Japanese-themed Koi fish pond in the center. It is designed with massive river rocks, exotic fountains, lily pads, and lotus. The pond overlooks the main living structure with paved walkways and streamlined green shrubs. The main suite opens up partly to the breakfast nook near the lush pond with koi fishes.</p><p>The Zen-like modern structure sits expensively in LA's private 90210 ZIP Code area. The secluded neighborhood has colossal acres of celebrity owners with profitable houses. Singer Adele recently bought a mega-mansion previously belonging to action star Sylvester Stallone for $58 million, thus making Ryan Seacrest’s palatial home the second most profitable property in the area.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Balenciaga Success Story: How It Became One Of The Biggest Names In Fashion</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NY Post</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daily Mail</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZaCasqx5yKeqopyVYr%2B6rc1mqp6Zk6eytMDSZmxqZZ2eua21zqdkm52mmr%2BtxYyhoKWko2K1sLnEaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
