That case was dismissed shortly thereafter. The claims are no more viable today than they were then. We are confident they will be dismissed again.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Foxx will reportedly be pursuing “a claim for malicious prosecution against this person and her attorneys for re-filing this frivolous action.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Original story below…</strong></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As the statute of limitations under the<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234729798> New York State Adult Survivors Act </a>draws near, several entertainment heavyweights have been hit with lawsuits with alleged victims citing claims of sexual abuse, sexual assault, and more. <a href=# id=auto-tag_cassie data-tag=cassie>Cassie</a> and <a href=# id=auto-tag_diddy data-tag=diddy>Diddy</a> <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234813727>quickly settled </a>their lawsuit last week after the singer <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234813328>publicized claims </a>of physical abuse, rape, and being forced to sleep with a “succession of male prostitutes.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Earlier today (Nov. 22), Jamie Foxx and <a href=# id=auto-tag_jimmy-iovine data-tag=jimmy-iovine>Jimmy Iovine</a> were both named in<a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234796308> new filings</a> under the act. Foxx is being accused of sexually assaulting a Jane Doe in 2015 at Catch NYC & Roof. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, Foxx was approached by the plaintiff and her friend to take a photo after being spotted. The woman claimed Foxx stated, “Sure, baby anything for you” but seemed intoxicated. While taking the photos, she noted that the <a href=# data-type=pmc_list data-id=1234809068>Oscar winner </a>commented, “Wow, you have that supermodel body” and mentioned that she bore a resemblance to his former on-screen love interest Gabrielle Union.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He then allegedly groped her breasts, penetrated her vagina and anus with his fingers, and stopped before her friend was in the vicinity. Doe claims the incident caused injury and emotional distress as a result of “sexual assault, abuse, assault and battery.” Foxx has not publicly addressed the allegations.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-1204034574.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Meanwhile, Iovine is being accused of sexual misconduct and abuse. According to <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, another Jane Doe claimed that she was “sexually abused, forcibly touched, and subjected to sexual harassment and retaliation” back in August 2007.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Iovine’s representations told the outlet that they were “shocked and baffled” at the motion. Adding, “This inquiry is the first we’ve heard of this matter. No one has ever made a claim like this against Jimmy Iovine, nor have we been contacted or made aware of any complaint by anyone, including this unknown plaintiff prior to now.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">After Cassie filed her lawsuit against Diddy, figures like <a href=#>Cuba Gooding Jr.</a>, Bill Cosby, <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234811204>L.A. Reid</a>, and more were named in new lawsuits involving alleged <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234750309>sex crimes</a>. The deadline to file motions under the Adult Survivors Act is Friday (Nov. 24).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2BurrXEZp2osKhit6q5zLJkoqemnrumecuarqytmanAbrrYZqqtmaSaeqKw1KWrZqulp8Oqws6rqmaZk6l6cn6SbW9qb2RrhHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
