In 2019, <a href=#>John Legend revealed that politics had put a strain on their relationship</a>.

Amid the online trolling, West also called out Kid Cudi for being friends with Davidson. Now, the Pursuit of Happiness rapper said that he can't be friends with <a href=#>the Yeezy founder</a> again. Here's a timeline of their broken friendship.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Kim Kardashian Isn't Happy With Kanye West Following Her Pete Davidson Split</a></span></p><h2 id=how-did-kanye-west-amp-kid-cudi-become-friends>How Did Kanye West & Kid Cudi Become Friends?</h2><p>The two met a few years before Cudi signed to West's G.O.O.D Music Label in 2008. The two would do a few collaborations after that, starting with 2009's Make Her Say from the former's album, Man on the Moon: The End of Day ‚Äî which launched his career at the age of 25. In 2013, Cudi eventually left the label but clarified that he and West didn't have a falling out.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Man, everything is cool," he said back then. "Everything is peace with everybody on the label. There's never been any issues, but I am announcing that I'm no longer on G.O.O.D. Music." He explained that he and <a href=#>the Jeen-Yuhs star</a> were simply headed in different directions.</p><p>But the next year, Cudi called out <a href=#>the billionaire</a> for using his vocals on Guilt Trip, a track from his acclaimed album Yeezus. "The vocal that I did on that song was a couple years old. I forgot which session it was, but it was just a reference," he said at the time. He didn't know West had used his vocals until internet sleuths had a trending discussion about it on Twitter. The Day 'N' Nite hitmaker initially felt "flattered" but later realized that he should have been properly featured in the song.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Then I started thinking about it more," he continued. "It was like, 'Why not call me and have me come in there and give it? Why underuse me? Why put four bars of vocals to coax my fans into thinking this is a legitimate Kid Cudi feature on this song and it isn't?'" The two engaged in a Twitter war for a while. But in September 2016, Cudi appeared on West's Saint Pablo Tour where they let fans know that they've made up.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Pete Davidson In Therapy After Kanye West's Attack?</a></span></p><h2 id=kanye-west-recently-dropped-kid-cudi-from-39-donda-2-39>Kanye West Recently Dropped Kid Cudi From 'Donda 2'</h2><p>Early this 2022, West reignited his feud with Cudi when he slammed him for being friends with Davidson. "Just so everyone knows Cudi will not be on Donda because he's friends with you know who," the rapper announced in a handwritten note published in a now-deleted Instagram post. "We all speak in Billie [Eilish] language now."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cudi didn't hold back in his response.</p><p>"Too bad I don't wanna be on ur album u f----n dinosaur hahaha ü§£," ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äãhe wrote in the comments. "Everyone knows ive been the best thing about ur albums since i met u. Ima pray for u brother. ‚úåüèæ" He also revealed that he and Ye had already discussed the collaboration and that the latter was reversing the story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"We talked weeks ago about this," Cudi added. "You're whack for flipping the script and posting this lie just for a look on the internet. You ain't no friend. BYE." On Twitter, the unfazed musician also expressed his gratitude for the beef, saying: "Oh man I'm too blessed ü•∞" and that "God opens the door so the wrong people can exit ur life." But as he was leaving the Sofi Stadium after the Super Bowl, Cudi lashed out at the paparazzi who asked him to say something to West. He furiously told the pap to "just go."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>10 Celebrities Who Became Fashion Designers</a></span></p><h2 id=why-kid-cudi-doesn-39-t-think-he-39-ll-be-friends-with-kanye-west-again>Why Kid Cudi Doesn't Think He'll Be Friends With Kanye West Again</h2><p>In a new interview, Cudi said that he has "zero tolerance for the wrong energies," including his rift with Ye. "Do you know how it feels to wake up one day, look at your social media, and you're trending because somebody's talking some s--- about you?" he said in his profile for Esquire's September 2022 issue. "And then you got this person's trolls sending you messages on Instagram and Twitter? All in your comments? That s--- pissed me off. That he had the power to f--- with me that week. That he used his power to f--- with me. That pissed me off. You f---ing with my mental health now, bro‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm at a place in my life where I have zero tolerance for the wrong energies," continued the rapper who just released another album and is starting a new Netflix project called Entergalactic. He also had a direct message for Ye. "I'm not one of your kids. I'm not Kim. It don't matter if I'm friends with Pete or not friends with Pete. None of this s--- had anything to do with me," he said.</p><p>‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã"If you can't be a grown man and deal with the fact that you lost your woman? That's not my f---ing problem. You need to own up to your s--- like every man in this life has. I've lost women, too. And I've had to own up to it. I don't need that in my life. I don't need it."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When asked if he'd consider patching things up with West, he said that it would take a "miracle" for it to happen. "With all due respect, I'm not Drake, who's about to take a picture with him next week and be friends again, and their beef is squashed," he explained. "That's not me. What I say, I mean. I will be done with you. It's gonna take a motherf---ing miracle for me and that man to be friends again. I don't see it happening. He gon' have to become a monk."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>What Happened Between Cardi B And Kanye West?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdoLalecKum6JllKSytLrTZquhoZ6geqmxy6Vkm51dm7%2Bqsc2dqmavmam1brfAp7CeZaeawLV5wKCYoqZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
