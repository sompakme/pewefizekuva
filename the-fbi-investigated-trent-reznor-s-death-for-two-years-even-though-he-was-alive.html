Between groups like <a href=#>Guns N' Roses picking fights</a>, bands like <a href=#>Queen having their song banned</a>, and more, there is always some kind of drama to report on.</p><p>For his part, Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor has been also been involved in drama including <a href=#>his strange relationship with Fred Durst</a>. However, the fact that The FBI once investigated Reznor's death for years even though he is alive truly is mind-blowing.</p><h2 id=why-the-fbi-think-trent-reznor-was-killed>Why The FBI Think Trent Reznor Was Killed</h2><p>Decades before Nine Inch Nails were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2020, the band's debut album was released in 1989. Produced on a shoestring budget, "Pretty Hate Machine" became a huge success because of Trent Reznor's vision and talent.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/trent-reznor-looking-confused.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The fact that Reznor didn't have a fortune to spend on his art at that time led to a truly amazing series of events. The production of Nine Inch Nails' first music video resulted in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the FBI investigating Reznor's death for two years</a> even as he became a star.</p><p>In 1989, a farmer made a truly strange discovery after something that traveled 100 miles fell from the sky onto his land. While traveling over his land, the farmer discovered a Super 8 camera with weather balloons tied to it which had floated down from the sky.</p><p>After the farmer called the local police, they watched the footage and called the FBI in. That footage featured two men standing over a third person who was lying on the ground that they believed had his life taken from him.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/nine-inch-nails-trent-reznor-saw-red-and-ignited-his-feud-with-marilyn-manson-by-kicking-him-out-of-his-studio.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor Saw Red And Ignited His Feud With Marilyn Manson By Kicking Him Out Of His Studio</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>The Nine Inch Nails frontman and Marilyn Manson went from friends to enemies.</span><p>After examining the footage, the FBI believed the third body was covered in a substance likely related to his passing. As the scene continued to play out, the camera floated up in the air away from the three figures until it ran out of film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Stars The FBI Has Opened Files On</a>:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Steve Jobs</strong></li><li><strong>Whitney Houston</strong></li><li><strong>Princess Diana</strong></li><li><strong>John Lennon</strong></li><li><strong>Yoko Ono</strong></li><li><strong>John Denver</strong></li><li><strong>Ol' Dirty Bastard</strong></li><li><strong>Tupac Shakur</strong></li><li><strong>Christopher “The Notorious B.I.G.” Wallace</strong></li></ul><p>Believing they'd discovered proof of a grisly crime, The FBI spent two years investigating without any luck. Ultimately, The FBI decided to try a Hail Mary by dropping off a still image of the supposed victim hoping to identify them.</p><p>Virtually immediately after that image was posted in a local college, the whole case hilariously broke open. When someone came forward, they informed the FBI there was no victim, no crime, and the person from the image was alive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/are-the-nine-inch-nails-band-members-and-trent-reznor-actually-friends-or-is-there-drama-behind-the-scenes_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Trent Reznor was planning the music video for his song "Down In It", he had a vision. Part of that vision was for the video to end on a shot of his character in the video expired on the ground with two of his bandmates standing over him.</p><p>Since Reznor didn't have a lot of money for his video, he had to get creative. Reznor's solution was to attach weather balloons to a camera that was tethered down. When the tethers snapped, the camera and its footage were seemingly lost forever. As for the substance seen on the body in the footage, that was made up of corn starch.</p><p>It is amazing to think how much time and money the FBI spent on their fruitless investigation. All the while, the body they were looking for was up on its feet touring the world and performing onstage for crowds of adoring music fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/trent-reznor-performing.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Courtney Love Slammed Nine Inch Nails' Frontman Trent Reznor, But Are Any Of Her Accusations Remotely True?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Courtney Love made an extremely disturbing accusation about Nine Inch Nails' Trent Reznor.</span><p>After the truth about what happened came to light, Reznor commented on the situation during interviews. When he was questioned for a Hard Copy segment that painted him in a very negative light, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reznor told his side of the story</a>.</p><p>"Six months ago, I got a call from my manager called me and said, 'you won't believe what just happened.' We got a call from an investigator in Chicago that thinks that I might be dead. So there was talk that I might have to go to Chicago to prove that I'm alive. But, I never had to do that. So, it's silly. Which is good."</p><p>One of the music video's producers, Eric Zimmermann, also commented on the situation which he clearly found funny. "It's interesting that our top government agency, the Federal Bureau of Intelligence, couldn't crack the Super 8 code."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/are-the-nine-inch-nails-band-members-and-trent-reznor-actually-friends-or-is-there-drama-behind-the-scenes_.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later during the same segment, Reznor explained that he found the whole situation funny as he mocked the police.</p><p>“My initial reaction was that it was really funny that something could be that blown out of proportion with this many people worked up about it. And I felt kind of good that the police made idiots of themselves."</p><h2 id=how-rich-is-trent-reznor>How Rich Is Trent Reznor?</h2><p>Looking back at Trent Reznor's career, it is amazing to think that he was ever so broke that he caused the FBI to get involved. After all, Reznor has enjoyed more than enough success that he could now self-finance a music video that uses cranes and all kinds of expensive equipment.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/trent-reznor-atticus-ross-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Are The Nine Inch Nails Band Members And Trent Reznor Actually Friends Or Is There Drama Behind The Scenes?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Here's the truth about how Trent Reznor, the talented lead singer of Nine Inch Nails, actually gets along with his bandmates.</span><p>According to Celebrity Net Worth, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reznor has accumulated a truly impressive $80 million fortune</a>. Given that impressive figure, it is fascinating to look at the many ways that Reznor has made his fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In his role as the leader of Nine Inch Nails, Reznor has released eleven albums to date. On top of that, Reznor and his famous band have released a slew of singles, remix albums, live albums, EPs, and he has contributed to several soundtracks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Reznor has also released albums and singles as a member of his side project, How to Destroy Angels. Reznor's most notable music work outside of Nine Inch Nails is as a film composer since he has contributed to several major movies.</p><p>Between all of Reznor's music, the companies he has formed including Nothing Records, and more, it makes sense he has become so rich.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGidm6Fdnru3sdKtoKCZpJqxbsDRnqWtZaKax6%2B70axknZ2RqbVuss6rZLKdkafAbsPHoqOeZZiaerit0maYpaGmmnw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
