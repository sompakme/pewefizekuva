Stewart Horejsi built much of his wealth by being an early investor in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway class A stock. He began purchasing the stock in 1980 for as little as $265 per share. He has invested a lot of that money in his own mutual fund but still owns Berkshire stock. Stewart Horejsi graduated from the University of Kansas in 1962. He then took over his family’s welding supply company. He is married with two children and resides in Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p>Today, he’s a billionaire with an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion. His 4,300 Class A shares are valued at nearly $750 million and his stake is larger than the stake controlled by Bill Gates. &nbsp;To put it simply, Horejsi got in early and held on. He built control of four closed-end stock funds and today manages them through Boulder Investment Advisers, LLC, his money management firm based in Boulder, Colorado. His funds own Berkshire shares of course, as well as interests in Wells Fargo, IBM, and Walmart – all of which are partly held by Berkshire Hathaway.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3C8xKinpZ1fqMGmw8Crq2agn6eyq7%2FIrGSnnaRixLC%2B06Fkm6GfnL%2BivMeyZJ%2BZk6l6pK3RnpyrZZGsrrOw0maYp5xdobansYysq6iqqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
