This isn't anything new for the series, which has seen a handful of co-stars come and go, including Naomie Olindo.</p><p>Olindo first joined the series back in season 3 when she and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig Conover</a> were dating. After being brought back on for a recurring spot in season four, Naomie was brought on full-time for her final two seasons before leaving.

The star first made it onto the show following her relationship with former co-star, Craig Conover.</p><p>Although the duo didn't work out, ending their relationship officially back in September 2017, Naomie remained on the series as a recurring guest. While the show has proven itself to be a top contender when it comes to drama, it appears to have been too much for Naomie.</p><p>After becoming a full-time cast member in seasons five and six, the star opted to leave the show after four seasons. The star first eluded to leaving back in May 2020 when she and fellow Southern Charm cast member, Chelsea Meisner, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">wouldn't be returning</a> for season seven, and she was right!</p><p>Naomie revealed that the toxicity between her former cast members was simply far too much to deal with any longer. Considering reality TV involves a lot of contriving and pre-meditated storylines, things can definitely get messy, and boy did they ever in Charleston, South Carolina!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>During a visit to The Skinny Confidential podcast, Naomie revealed the reason behind her leaving, and as fans guessed, she just couldn't take it anymore, says <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slice.</a></p><p>"...People will strategize and once it starts getting to that point, it can get so toxic," she said during her interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Everything We Know About The ‘Southern Charm’ And ‘Summer House’ Mashup Series</a></span></p><p>The decision to leave the show came months following Olindo's dad passing away in late 2019. The star took to her social media to thank fans for their ongoing support following her father's battle with cancer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for Naomie, she has since moved on from the show and found happiness in her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">newest relationship with Metul Shah.</a></p><p>The duo celebrated their second anniversary together back in May, and have been quite public when it comes to their romance.</p><p>Naomie isn't shy to share tidbits of her relationship on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, documenting her life and the adventures she and Shah go on.</p><p>Currently, the couple is vacationing it up in none other than Antigua, however, travel is no stranger to the two of them.
