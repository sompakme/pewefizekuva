She allegedly insulted her, which Taylor's fans, of course, were furious about, but Reba is now setting the record straight.</p><h2 id=reba-mcentire-denies-having-called-taylor-swift-a-39-brat-39>Reba McEntire Denies Having Called Taylor Swift A 'Brat'</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/taylor-swift-super-bowl.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Taylor Swift showed up at the Super Bowl in support of Travis Kelce, it was an emotional moment, since she had to literally travel halfway across the world just to get there. She stayed in a suite with her family and the Kelce family, and while obviously the main focus was on the game, there were a lot of people who were mindful of what the pop star was doing.</p><p><strong>A post was made saying that Reba McEntire had been keeping an eye on Taylor during the event and that she thought she was a brat</strong>, but the country singer categorically denies having any sort of beef with Taylor Swift.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:19</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/taylor-swift-s-relationship-with-travis-kelce-is-drastically-different-from-her-past-famous-romances-front-deposit-back-commons-licences.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Taylor Swift’s Relationship With Travis Kelce Is Drastically Different From Her Past Famous Romances</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>There are a lot of unique things about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift's fascinating relationship.</span><p>"Please don’t believe everything you see on the Internet. <strong>I did not say this</strong>," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she clarified recently</a>.

The reports of what Reba McEntire had allegedly said were very harsh, and not something anyone would want people to think you said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A Facebook page made a viral post with fake statements from the singer, saying that "<strong>Reba McIntire [sic] talks about how disappointed she was to look up at the big screen while performing The National Anthem, only to see Taylor Swift laughing and drinking and making a mockery of the event.</strong>" The post also said that Reba had stated <strong>"I let her have it afterward. She's an entitled little brat."</strong></p><p>Considering that the Facebook page didn't even write Reba's name correctly, the chances of the statement being true are very slim, but of course, if something becomes viral, whether or not it's true stops mattering. So, it was a good thing that Reba McEntire clarified it before the rumors got out of hand.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipnpqRYrqksc2toKudXai5ornSZp2ao5Viu6bD0manq5mZqLK0edOasKWnomLAuLXFrWSdnZ6esrR5xK%2Bcq2WTlrmttc2gZKGdomKvs63TaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
