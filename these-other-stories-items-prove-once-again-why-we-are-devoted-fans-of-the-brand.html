A quick perusal of the label's new arrivals section is all it takes to have your wish list blow up with essentials for the upcoming season.</p><h2 id=how-amp-other-stories-came-about>How & Other Stories Came About</h2><p>At the very beginning, the H&M team behind the secret project, Stories, initially envisioned it as a way to promote a new beauty line, but they soon realized they had a lot more to say. As a result, the name & Other Stories comes from the fact that the authors always intended for their work to be an assortment of tales told from different perspectives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They're running three design studios in other parts of the world to double down on this goal. While their main office and most of their designers are in Stockholm, Sweden, they also have a branch in Los Angeles, California, that focuses on ready-to-wear. Each atelier's designs are unique from those of any other atelier, but they are still sold and displayed next to those of ateliers from other cities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the brand finally launched in 2013, many people fell in love with the carefully curated fashion brand thanks to its elevated pieces, which are typically minimalist in design but feature an exciting detail or twist. & Other Stories is a little more expensive than its sister brand, but the clothes' quality is undeniable, so we have no problem shelling out a few extra bucks for something that will last longer than a couple of washes.</p><h2 id=how-the-brand-39-s-design-system-operates>How The Brand's Design System Operates</h2><p>& Other Stories releases a variety of new lines of clothing each season. The films and photo stories featured on the website and social media channels are all inspired by different locations, and each collection or "story" is based on a different site. The label is known for releasing "co-labs," or collaborative efforts with other artists and businesses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Examples include capsule collections designed with Rodarte and Lykke Li, Toms and Central Saint Martins alumna Sadie Williams, and others. Collaboration partners can be found in various places and often include people you wouldn't expect.</p><p>See our curated selection of the best & Other Stories pieces from the most recent collection that is now available to buy online.</p><h2 id=this-extra-large-belted-wool-coat-designed-by-in-stockholm>This Extra-Large, Belted Wool Coat, Designed by In Stockholm</h2><p>To put it mildly, <a href=#>this double-breasted wool coat </a>with a tonal self-tie belt is stunning.
