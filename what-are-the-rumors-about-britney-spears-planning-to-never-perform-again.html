Or is the '...Baby One More Time' singer just taking a break from performing?</p><h2 id=britney-said-she-wouldn-39-t-perform-under-her-conservatorship><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Britney Said She Wouldn't Perform Under Her Conservatorship</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Writing online this summer while still under the control of her father and the conservatorship, Britney declared that the would not be performing 'anytime soon' while under it. “For those of you who choose to criticize my dancing videos … look I’m not gonna be performing on any stages anytime soon with my dad handling what I wear, say, do, or think. I’ve done that for the past 13 years.” Spears said any 'performances' would be released on social media from her home, and not the stage, writing: “And no I’m not gonna put on heavy makeup and try try try on stage again and not be able to do the real deal with remixes of my songs for years and begging to put my new music in my show for MY fans … so I quit.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=she-39-s-described-her-last-tour-as-traumatic><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>She's Described Her Last Tour As Traumatic</span></h2><p>The Circus singer has not performed on stage since the end of her highly successful Britney: Live in Concert Tour ended on October 21, 2018. The tour placed an enormous strain on the singer, and she has claimed that she suffered enormous trauma, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">describing the experience around her live performance as more than enough to make retirement feel like freedom.</a> In her court testimonial in June, Spears stated that she informed her management that the Britney: Pieces of Me Las Vegas residency, which she had been performing for four years, had become overwhelming, and that she dearly wanted to stop.</p><h2 id=britney-doesn-39-t-neccessarily-want-her-old-life-back><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Britney Doesn't Neccessarily Want Her Old Life Back</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Britney has been celebrating her freedom from the conservatorship, and though she values the new opportunities which her father's removal presents her, she doesn't neccessarily see a return to her old life, at least not straight away. Writing on Instagram, she said: "Although there is change and things to celebrate in my life, I still have a lot of healing to do. Thankfully I have a good support system and am taking time to understand it's ok to slow down and breathe."</p><h2 id=touring-placed-immense-pressure-on-the-star><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Touring Placed Immense Pressure On The Star</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Its no mystery that international touring puts performers under incredible strain. Many famous singers and musicians have been honest about not enjoying the performance side of their careers. Michael Jackson famously hated it, describing touring as like "going through hell." Britney, who has been performing on-and-off since 1999, is no stranger to the rigours of touring, and has been clear that she is now prioritising her health and well-being over the needs of fans and tour managers to fulfill performing obligations.</p><h2 id=britney-has-other-dreams-beyond-performing><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Britney Has Other Dreams Beyond Performing</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The star has been honest about her desire to move on in her life, and focus on following her own dreams and nurturing her family life, having opened up in the past about her desire to have more children, and recently announcing her engagement to boyfriend Sam. Many fans were concerned last week when Britney posted barely-clothed images of herself online while on holiday celebrating, captioning her posts: 'A beautiful day here in paradise celebrating.' However, fiancé Sam has declared his intention to 'take care' of Britney. The two have big plans together, and will be busy working on wedding preparations no doubt.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>#FreeBritney Supporters Looking To Free Amanda Bynes Next, But Instagram Users Disagree</a></span></p><h2 id=what-else-will-britney-be-working-on><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>What Else Will Britney Be Working On?</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn't seem that Britney has any big music plans for life now that her father's conservatorship is over. In fact, she's taking up all kinds of other hobbies! She's taken up flying lessons - which are symbolic of her new-found freedom and 'finding her wings' - writing on Instagram: 'On cloud 9 right now !!!! First time flying a plane and first time in a prop plane !!! Geez I was scared !!! Pssss bringing the ship home, JL ... Stay classy beautiful people !!!! New pics coming soon !!!!'</p><p>So, Britney has lots in the pipeline for the future, but its not neccessarily music-related.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Britney Spears Fans Say She Should Retire And Be Free After Rumors She 'May Never Perform Again'</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYq6zsYyrrKanoqh6o77IraWesV2ovaat0axkqaSRo7uqusZmq6hlnprDpr6MqZyrnp%2Bnum6txpqgp2WalrqqsYysmKZlkai0qa3RomY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
