“[Her attendance] is Bravo’s version of [the] Make-A-Wish Foundation,” Jeff, 53, said while sitting beside Andy Cohen during the “Ask Andy” BravoCon panel on Friday, November 3, confirming that Pulos, 50, was in attendance this weekend.
Even though they both made the trip to Las Vegas for the three-day fan convention, Jeff made it very clear that there will be no reconciliation with Jenni."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Years later, however, he appeared to change his tune.</p><p>Jeff claimed that Jenni “changed” who she was when the cameras were rolling after she and ex-husband <strong>Chris Elwood</strong> split in 2008.</p><p>“I would say this to her face, I do believe that over the years she changed — in the sense of, not who she was off the cameras, but who she was on the cameras,” he said on Jeff Lewis Live in 2020. “Jenni was funny, she was sarcastic, she was edgy, she was dark. And then what happened was, around season 2 or season 3, when her husband left her, and it was devastating, there was an outpour, a huge outpour of condolences.”</p><p>He went on to say it was “almost like she became, kind of, <a href=#>a victim on camera</a>.” From that point on, Jeff claimed she was “more edited and more self-aware on camera.”</p><p>Jeff offered an update on his relationship with Jenni on <a href=# rel=noopener>WWHL</a> in February 2021.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I reached out to her about a year ago and did not hear back,” he recalled at the time. “I also ran into her — we were at the same restaurant, but we did not talk to each other. I had tried to send her both drinks and dessert, both of which were refused. … I got my answer there.”</p><p>With reporting by Sarah Hearon</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGenpZiuabDyKxko6ebmsButsSnpaJloKq5sL%2BMoKatZZ2WuKZ5wGauoquYYravwsitnGasn2Kvs63VqJqopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
