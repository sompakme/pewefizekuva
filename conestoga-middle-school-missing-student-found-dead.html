The cause of death remains unknown.</p><p>The death of 13-year-old Milana Li, whose body was found in a stream in Oregon, is being investigated as a homicide.&nbsp;</p><p>The girl was last seen around her family’s apartment at 4 pm on Sunday, but her mother did not report her missing until 1 pm the following day, claiming she was a runaway.&nbsp;</p><p>The police were alerted to ‘suspicious circumstances’ near the Westside Linear Park and discovered the girl’s body in the area. However, it is still unclear how she died.</p><p>Li was in the sixth grade at Conestoga Middle School, which provided counselors for students and staff on Wednesdays.<strong>“There are no words to express the grief of losing a child,”</strong> said Principal Zan Hess.</p><p>Following an autopsy, the Beaverton Police Department confirmed that Milana Li’s death was a homicide, and they are treating the case as an ongoing investigation. Nevertheless, they have assured the community that there is no continued threat to the public.</p><p>A makeshift memorial has been erected at the spot where Li’s body was found. People have placed multiple candles, baby dolls, stuffed animals, and flowers to show their respect. Some have even planted lavender in honor of the victim.</p><p>The family has set up a GoFundMe page to cover the funeral expenses, which has raised more than $26,000 of the $50,000 target.</p><p>Savanna Tinline, a classmate of Milana’s, said that the memorial is a touching tribute to her friend.&nbsp;She and her mother planted lavender near the stream because Milana loved purple flowers.&nbsp;</p><p>Malikai Johnson and his mother, Kortnie, also visited the site to drop off a Beanie Baby in honor of Li. They did so to support their friends who were depressed and sad after hearing the <a href=#>news</a>.</p><p>However, the tragedy has left the community shaken. Kortnie said she would be more vigilant with her eight-year-old son after the incident, despite feeling safe in the area before.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary Stanley, a grandmother who frequently walks the trail with her granddaughter, was devastated to hear about the incident.&nbsp;</p><p>She and her granddaughter had prayed for Milana’s safe return the previous night. The sight of the memorial was difficult for them both, and Stanley said that she couldn’t imagine what Milana’s <a href=#>family</a> must be going through.</p><p>The Beaverton Police Department has reported receiving several tips from the community and is actively investigating the case. Meanwhile, the family is left to mourn the tragic loss of their daughter.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunCvzqecrKyfnK5uucidm6WdXaiwqbvOpWSmoaOotq%2BzjKyrrpyVo8Fuss6upZ1llJqupXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
