After all, Lautner played a major role in the wildly successful Twilight film franchise and he also was an extremely good-looking young man. In Hollywood, those two facts alone could be the perfect recipe for years of success. Unfortunately for Lautner, however, it has been years since he has seemed poised to take Hollywood by storm.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>All The Women Taylor Lautner Has Been Romantically Linked To</a></span>Even though Taylor Lautner’s career may not be going as strong as he likely hoped, there is still no doubt that he has a lot to be thankful for. After all, <a href=#>Lautner is engaged to his fiancéeTay Dome</a> and they seem very happy together. Before Lautner found the woman he is set to marry, however, he dated several famous women. With that in mind, it is interesting to compare how much Lautner’s famous exes are worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-maika-monroe-worth><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>How Much Is Maika Monroe Worth?</span></h2><p>In the year 2014, horror fans all over the world were blown away to learn how amazing Maika Monroe is due to her role in one of the best scary movies of the modern era. However, Taylor Lautner saw Monroe’s appeal before most people since he briefly dated her in May of 2013. Best known for her truly compelling performance in the horror movie It Follows, Monroe has shown up in several other films. For example, Monroe was a part of movies like The Guest, Independence Day: Resurgence, Honey Boy, and Watcher. Thanks to being cast in all of those films and several others, Monroe has a $1 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'It Follows' Director Will Give A New Take On Superheroes In New Film</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-is-marie-avgeropoulos-worth><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>How Much Is Marie Avgeropoulos Worth?</span></h2><p>During the mid-2010s, Taylor Lautner dated Marie Avgeropoulos for over a year in 2013 and 2014. Even though Lautner and Avgeropoulos couldn’t make their relationship work, there is no indication that their time together was especially dramatic. Considering that <a href=#>Avgeropoulos later was charged with felony domestic violence</a>, that is a really good thing. In an interesting twist, Lautner’s relationship with Avgeropoulos seems to indicate that he has a knack for dating actors just before they get their big break. After all, Avgeropoulos became a star in 2014, the same year she broke up with Lautner, due to her role in the drama series The 100. Thanks mostly to the fact that she starred in that show for six years, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Avgeropoulos has a $2 million fortune</a> according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-billie-lourd-worth><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>How Much Is Billie Lourd Worth?</span></h2><p>Before Taylor Lautner got engaged, his last confirmed girlfriend was Billie Lourd who he dated for six months in 2016 and 2017. Lucky enough to have developed a relationship with Ryan Murphy, Lourd starred in his show Scream Queens and she has appeared in several seasons of his series American Horror Story. On top of that, Lourd also notably portrayed Lieutenant Connix in the Star Wars sequel trilogy. Of course, that fact makes sense since even though <a href=#>Lourd is an accomplished actor in her own right</a>, she also is the daughter of Carrie Fisher. Thanks to all of the work she has done as an actor and anything she inherited after her mom passed, Lourd has a $20 million fortune according to celebritynetworth.com.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-much-is-lily-collins-worth><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>How Much Is Lily Collins Worth?</span></h2><p>Evidently, Taylor Lautner is attracted to the daughters of legends. After all, on top of dating Carrie Fisher’s daughter, for almost a year in 2010 and 2011 he also dated the daughter of the legendary singer and drummer Phil Collins, Lily Collins. Of course, just like Billie Lourd, Lily is a lot more than just the daughter of Phil Collins.

After that show ended, Gomez moved on to movie roles In films like the Hotel Transylvania series, Spring Breakers, and Monte Carlo among others. Also a very successful pop star, Gomez has released a long list of hit songs including “Come & Get It”, “Lose You to Love Me”, “The Heart Wants What It Wants”, and “Love You Like a Love Song”. Given all of the success she has enjoyed, it shouldn't surprise anyone that according to celebritynetworth.com, Gomez has an impressive $85 million fortune.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Really Happened Between Selena Gomez And Taylor Lautner?</a></span></p><h2 id=how-much-is-taylor-swift-worth><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>How Much Is Taylor Swift Worth?</span></h2><p>Soon after Selena Gomez and Taylor Lautner went their separate ways, he moved on and got involved with Taylor Swift who he dated from September to December 2009.
