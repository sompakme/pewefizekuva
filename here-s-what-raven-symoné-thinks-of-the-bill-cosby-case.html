Raven-Symon<span class=s1>é</span>, one of the show's early staples, played Bill's on-screen step-granddaughter, so she was pretty close to Cosby at one point.</p><p>Other stars felt the same, and many grew up on set. For example, Keshia Knight Pulliam spent many of her formative years on the Bill Cosby show, and it shaped her future in the industry.</p><p>Though <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">former child star Keshia Knight Pulliam initially supported Bill Cosby</a>, she did later flip the script. Eventually, she stopped endorsing Bill and claiming he was innocent, though her silence didn't say as much as her initial backing of the disgraced actor did.</p><p>Raven-Symoné, however, had different thoughts.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's What Rudy Huxtable From 'The Cosby Show' Looks Like Now</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans may not know much about Raven-Symoné's personal life</a>, but she did speak out honestly about the Cosby situation.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Billboard</a>&nbsp;reported that&nbsp;Raven-Symoné didn't speak out until rumors began circulating that she'd been affected by Bill's reported bad behavior. At that point, the actress spoke out on social media, saying she'd never been a victim of Cosby.</p><p>A year later, on 'The View,' the Disney star explained that she needed more information to really make a determination on whether the claims were true about Bill. Of course, in one interview, Raven-Symoné did say "I want everybody who deserves justice to get justice."</p><p>That's a pretty diplomatic way of saying she feels like justice is deserved in the situation. And while she was careful with her words,&nbsp;Raven-Symoné also didn't attend Cosby's trial or smile in photos with him while he tried his best to stay out of prison.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Further, Raven explained that "I don’t call it ‘hard’ or ‘challenging,’ because I try not to internalize it." That's a healthy way to look at the situation,&nbsp;especially for someone who's grown up in the spotlight the way Raven did.</p><p>With her newest Disney show and her recent marriage making headlines,&nbsp;Raven-Symoné is doing just fine for herself. And she clearly doesn't need or want the notoriety that would come with speaking out further on the Bill Cosby case. Instead, the star is happy to let justice run its course in the courts.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Cosby Says Prison Is An Amazing Experience, And Here's Why</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYr%2BiwsSnZKyxnaS7pnnSmrCsZZGXvLbAjJugpaRdmLy0rtho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
