Since then, Campbell has remained a loyal advocate for the brand and continues to be an ambassador for its iconic designs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/instar51099707.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In addition to these prominent figures, other celebrities have also publicly endorsed Versace without any financial incentive.
