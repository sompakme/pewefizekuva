Sure, some celebrities seem to grow out of their fame and want to lead normal lives, but that doesn't mean their fan base can forget about them so easily. Here are 10 of our favorite Nickelodeon stars who are now living their lives away from the peering lens of a camera.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Framing Britney Spears' Director Discusses What Didn't Make It Into The Documentary</a></span></p><h2 id=zoey-101-star-alexa-nikolas><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>‘Zoey 101’ Star&nbsp;Alexa Nikolas</span></h2><p>Along with starring alongside Jamie Lynn Spears in&nbsp;Zoey 101,&nbsp;former actress&nbsp;Alexa Nikolas starred in other hit series like&nbsp;Hidden Hills, Revelations,&nbsp;and even&nbsp;The Walking Dead.&nbsp;But after Nikolas starred in an episode of&nbsp;Mad Men&nbsp;in 2013, she disappeared from the screen in order to focus on her marriage to Canadian musician, Milosh. Unfortunately, they split up and now Nikolas has given birth to her first child with partner Michael Gray.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=the-amanda-show-star-amanda-bynes><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>‘The Amanda Show’ Star Amanda Bynes</span></h2><p>Amanda Bynes has to be the most famous actor on this list that walked away from the screen - but with good reason. Bynes shot to fame with her sitcoms&nbsp;The Amanda Show,&nbsp;and What I Like About You&nbsp;(and apparently <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">almost starred in the show&nbsp;The New Girl)</a>&nbsp;before jumping to the big screen. However, later in life, Bynes struggled with substance abuse and faced a plethora of legal issues. While she announced in 2018 that she intended to return to the screen, she appears to be still working on herself.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trolls Say Amanda Bynes' New Rap Song Gives Them 'Walking Dead' Vibes</a></span></p><h2 id=unfabulous-star-raja-fenske><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>‘Unfabulous’ Star&nbsp;Raja Fenske</span></h2><p>Raja Fenske was known by his fans as Jake Behari from the series&nbsp;Unfabulous,&nbsp;which launched the career of castmate Emma Roberts. And while he appeared on other popular shows like&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire&nbsp;and&nbsp;CSI: Miami,&nbsp;Fenski dropped out of the acting game after starring in the 2013 comedy&nbsp;Pendejo.&nbsp;</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=clarissa-explains-it-all-star-jason-zimbler><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>‘Clarissa Explains It All’ Star Jason Zimbler</span></h2><p>Everyone, and we mean EVERYONE considered Jason Zimbler the best and the ultimate, annoying little brother EVER. He played Ferguson, the bratty little brother of Clarissa (Melissa Joan Hart) on the hit show&nbsp;Clarissa Explains It All. Afterwards, fans may not know but he also appeared on stage before bowing out from acting in general. We do miss that nagging little guy, though.</p><h2 id=are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-star-ross-hull><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>‘Are You Afraid Of The Dark’ Star Ross Hull</span></h2><p>Older <span class=aCOpRe>millennials</span> will recall the gloaming glare of actor Ross Hull, who played the leader of the Midnight Society in the spooky series Are You Afraid of the Dark.&nbsp;But what they don't know (at least some don't) is that Hull is actually a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">massive weather personality in Canada</a>! Currently, he is a meteorologist for Global News and works out of Toronto. While we're super happy for him, we do miss his fearful faces when it comes to supernatural events happening in the Nickelodeon world.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=blue-s-clues-star-steve-burns><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>‘Blue's Clues' Star Steve Burns</span></h2><p>If fans were to have taken a look at former&nbsp;Blue's Clues&nbsp;star Steve Burns today, they probably wouldn't recognize him. From 1996-2002, Burns and his cartoon dog Blue would entertain young children all over the nation. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">After that, he jumped into film work</a> and musician stuff. Heck, he even released a children's album in 2016 under the name "STEVENSTEVEN." While he may not be in front of the camera anymore, fans will always know him as Blue's bestie.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of Chilling Adventures of Sabrina Ranked By Instagram Followers</a></span></p><h2 id=drake-amp-josh-star-scott-halberstadt><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>‘Drake & Josh’ Star Scott Halberstadt</span></h2><p>Fans probably won't believe it, but Scott Halberstadt, the actor who played Eric in the show&nbsp;Drake & Josh,&nbsp;actually took the massive leap from in front of the camera to the world of advertising with some commercials. He hasn't had a credible acting role since 2010, though, but appears to be doing just fine. According to his own Twitter<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">f</a> bio, he is a "<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0"><a href=#>former actor, research nerd, father</a>, video game player, classic wrestling enthusiast, fantasy football savant."</span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=all-that-star-christina-kirkman><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>‘All That’ Star Christina Kirkman</span></h2><p>It's hard to believe that Christina Kirkman went from being one of the youngest faces on All That (from 2003-2005) to venturing almost completely away from the screen, and for a depressing reason. After the popular show ended, Kirkman moved back from L.A. to her home state of Massachusetts and stopped <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">acting due to bullying</a>. She did end up moving back to the West Coast but works as a social media community manager for Enabler Media.</p><h2 id=spectacular-star-simon-curtis><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>‘Spectacular!’ Star Simon Curtis</span></h2><p>He may have been a popular actor, especially when it came to&nbsp;Spectacular! but now, Simon Curtis seems to be focusing hardcore on his music career, where he has released a ton of studio albums in the Dance/Electronic genre.</p><h2 id=zoey-101-star-kristin-herrera><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>‘Zoey 101’ Star Kristin Herrera</span></h2><p>Zoey 101&nbsp;actress Kristin Herrera&nbsp;kept up the acting even after the popular Nickelodeon show was over. However, it might be hard to bounce back after she was written off the program because producers "thought she looked too old next to her co-star" (something that was never confirmed by the network itself). While her last acting part was for the soap opera&nbsp;General Hospital,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on her Instagram</a> fans can still find her .</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Disney Channel Stars Of The 2000s, Ranked By Current Net Worth</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhoaWWWpL%2BusdFmpaKbm5q5sLDEqKVmmZOpvLO%2FjLCfqGWcnsOmecuinZ5ln5uzbr%2FCq5yepl2jvLh7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
