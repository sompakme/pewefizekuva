If you’re constantly craving sweets, get <b>more magnesium, chromium, and tryptophan</b> in your diet. These nutrients are found in whole, natural foods, such as broccoli, dried beans, liver, eggs, poultry, legumes, and grains, or you can get them via supplementation.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-does-it-mean-when-you-crave-a-certain-food></span>What does it mean when you crave a certain food?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Food cravings can be caused by a variety of physical or mental factors. They may be a <b>sign of hormonal imbalances</b>, a suboptimal diet, high stress levels, or a lack of sleep or physical activity. Food cravings are seldom a sign that you’re lacking the nutrients found in that food.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-early-do-pregnancy-cravings-start></span>How early do pregnancy cravings start?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>If you do start having cravings, it’ll probably be in your first trimester (<b>it could be as early as 5 weeks into pregnancy</b>).
