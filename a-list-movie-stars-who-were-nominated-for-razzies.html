That high honor grants you another level of respect among the film industry. It also means that your career will no doubt be given a boost as a result. Actors in Hollywood dream of reaching this A-list level alongside the great legends. Most A-list actors have received some kind of recognition from the Academy. If they haven't won, they've at least been nominated at some point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, these actors aren't safe from the <a href=#>Golden Raspberry Awards</a>. This is a parody award show which takes the opposite tone from most award shows. Instead of rewarding great acting, it rewards bad acting. This is not the kind of reputation an actor wants to have. But even the biggest A-listers have been nominated for and won Razzies in their career.</p><p>Here are eight A-list actors who have been honored with Razzies at some point in their career.</p><h2 id=ben-affleck><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Ben Affleck</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ben Affleck is one of Hollywood's most recognizable actors. He is a two-time Oscar winner who has starred in films such as Good Will Hunting and Gone Girl. However, his A-list status hasn't made him immune to harsh criticism. Affleck has been nominated at the Razzies a number of times over the years. Affleck has won Razzies for Gigli, Daredevil, and Paycheck. When Larry King tried to present Affleck with one of the trophies, he destroyed it during the interview.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Bruce Willis Bags Exclusive Category In Razzies Nominations For 8 Bad Performances</a></span></p><h2 id=halle-berry><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Halle Berry</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Halle Berry is not someone people usually think of when bad actresses come to mind. The A-lister has even won an Academy Award for Best Actress. The honor came thanks to Berry's performance alongside Billy Bob Thornton in the film Monster's Ball. However, when Berry starred in Catwoman, the Razzies decided it was time to honor her as well. Unlike most stars who are nominated, <a href=#>Berry actually showed up to the ceremony to accept her trophy</a>. Of course, she accepted the Razzie while holding her Oscar in the other hand.</p><h2 id=sandra-bullock><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Sandra Bullock</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Sandra Bullock starred in the action-thriller Speed in 1994, her career took off.
