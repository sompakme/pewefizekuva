Their fame may not have been the only thing driving a wedge between them. There have been theories that Joe cheated on Taylor, with the singer appearing to drop hints leading up to her album’s release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Most recently, the globe in Taylor’s Spotify library pop-up included a pain on Orlando, Florida, leading <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">fans to theorize that’s where Joe cheated</a> on her. Prior to that, Swift seemed to be hinting at her ex’s infidelity on the Eras tour.</p><p>Speculation <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">initially surfaced following Taylor's performance</a> in Melbourne, Australia, as part of her Eras Tour on February 17. During the show, she delivered a mashup of three tracks: “Getaway Car,” “August,” and “The Other Side of the Door.” These song selections immediately caught the attention of fans, as they all centered around themes of cheating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A week later, the rumors intensified when Taylor performed another mashup, this time featuring “You’re Not Sorry” and “Should’ve Said No,” on February 24 in Sydney. Given that “Should’ve Said No” revolves around ending a relationship due to a partner's unfaithfulness, many fans connected this performance to the previous speculation.</p><p>Needless to say, fans are excited to get more details when Taylor drops her album in only a day!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llpqyrb%2BMrJifnV2lv7DAxJyrnpxdqb%2BiwsisZKSdnJiybrDErZiipKNit7CxjJqjsLGeqHqktMSaq6Kml2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
