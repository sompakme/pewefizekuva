Vin Diesel and goddaughter Meadow Walker had a close bond even before Paul Walker’s death in 2013 — and they’ve remained a tight-knit duo since his passing.
Diesel formed a friendship with Paul when they both starred in 2001’s The Fast and the Furious. The men went on to play BFFs Dominic Toretto and Brian O’Conner, respectively, in four more Fast and Furious films before Paul was killed in a single-vehicle car crash at the age of 40."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Bloodshot star explained that he feels “very protective” of Meadow and <a href=#>her father’s legacy</a> within the racing&nbsp;franchise.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“The whole point of the Fast and Furious saga is the idea that brotherhood can be created by bond and not necessarily blood,” Diesel underscored at the time. “So much of Fast and Furious is celebrated by brotherhood that’s eternal. I never in a million years imagined 21 years ago that, beyond the script and the film, there would be this other guiding light, this other driving force that propels you to be as passionate as you can and manifest in the movie. … We’re all mortals, but love is immortal.”</p><p>Scroll down to see how Diesel has maintained a strong bond with Meadow over the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkw6q6jJ2gnquVoXqiusNmpJ6ZlKTEbsPApaKeqqNiwLixxK2crKxdoryusc2tqmanppq%2FbsDHnmSynZGnwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
