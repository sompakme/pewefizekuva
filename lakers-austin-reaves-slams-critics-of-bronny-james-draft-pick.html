In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, Reaves, 26, made a strong statement to critics of the Lakers drafting Bronny, 19, the oldest son of LeBron James, in last month’s NBA Draft.
“Most of the criticism comes from people that really don’t have anything going on,” Reaves said Saturday, July 13, at the 2024 American Century Championship at Edgewood Tahoe Resort."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I know for a fact that he just wants to create his own lane and wants to be as good as he can. You tip your hat to a guy like that.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>Bronny was <a href=#>drafted by the Lakers</a> after playing one season at the University of Southern California, where he averaged 4.8 points per game. Critics have pointed to nepotism and his father’s influence as a major reasons for his second-round selection — but Reaves isn’t expecting the weight on Bronny’s shoulders to cripple him.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>“He’s been in the spotlight ever since he’s been young,” he noted. “He handles it like a professional already. I know he’ll do the same coming in here. He’ll put the work in.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>However, Reaves joked about being off the hook for a teaching role during Bronny’s first year as a pro.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Lakers-Austin-Reaves-Pushes-Back-at-Bronny-Critics-People-That-Don-t-Have-Anything-Going-On-792-797.jpg><p class=p3><span class=s3>“If I have LeBron as my dad, I don’t know if I’m relying on me to be a mentor,” Reaves said with a laugh.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>In addition to drafting Bronny, the Lakers made another splash this offseason when they hired former Duke star and ESPN analyst <strong>JJ Redick</strong> as <a href=#>their new head coach</a>.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>Given the fact that Redick, 40, has no prior professional coaching experience, the decision also raised some eyebrows. But Reaves is similarly unfazed about daggers being thrown at the new guy in charge.</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>“I mean, I’m out here golfing and people are heckling me about golf. I don’t even golf for a living,” Reaves said. “So you’re always going to get [criticism]. If you aren’t getting some, you probably aren’t doing something right. He’s one of the most hated people in Duke history, so I’m sure it’s fueling him to learn more, ask questions and be the best coach he can be. People are gonna say whatever the hell they wanna say.”</span></p><p class=p3><span class=s3>Before basketball season tips off in October, Reaves has been working on his golf game.&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p3><span class=s3>The former Oklahoma Sooner star — who has been a brand ambassador for <a href=# rel=noopener>TravisMathew</a> since February — spoke to <i>Us </i>after his second round the star-studded American Century Championship, where he ultimately finished in a tie for 13th place.
