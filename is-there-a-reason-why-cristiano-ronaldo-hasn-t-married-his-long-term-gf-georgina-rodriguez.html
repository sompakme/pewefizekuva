The two have been in a relationship since 2016, after meeting in a Gucci store where Georgina was working as a sales assistant.</p><p>Both experienced an instant connection at that first meeting. In an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interview with Elle Italia, Georgina said</a>: "It was love at first sight for both of us."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cristiano-ronaldo-makes-a-fortune-from-his-nike-commercials-but-does-his-son-even-get-paid-to-co-star-in-them_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Cristiano Ronaldo Makes A Fortune From His Nike Commercials, But Does His Son Even Get Paid To Co-Star In Them?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Cristiano Ronaldo Jr. is becoming a star thanks to being featured in his father's commercials, here's whether he's actually making a profit.</span><h2 id=why-cristiano-ronaldo-and-georgina-rodriquez-aren-39-t-married>Why Cristiano Ronaldo And Georgina Rodriquez Aren't Married</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cristiano-ronaldo.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ronaldo certainly isn’t afraid of telling the world how he feels about Georgina: The five-time Ballon d'Or winner has often spoken of his love for Gio, as he calls her. "I didn't think at the beginning that [the relationship] would be this strong. That I would fall in love with her," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ronaldo shared in IAG</a>. "I didn't expect it honestly. But after a while I felt that she was the woman of my life."</p><p>They've put their love on display multiple times. For example, in celebration of her 28th birthday, he had an image of her blazoned across the tallest building in the world. The three-minute laser show which flashed onto the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Burj Khalifa also celebrated the premiere of Georgina’s docu-series</a>. With their love for each other so evident, fans are confused about why the couple hasn’t taken the step of getting married.</p><p>But it just doesn't seem to be a priority for the couple. In March 2023, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgina said she and Cristiano are married in "the eyes of God." </a>With no marriage certificate made public, it's suspected that Georgina meant because they function like any legally married couple, they're already man and wife, even if not in the eyes of the law.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I really couldn't be more married.

She grew up in the Spanish city of Jaxa, near the French border. Determined to work in the world of luxury goods, she moved to Madrid, where she landed a job at the Gucci store. At the time of the meeting that changed her life, Georgina was sharing a cramped house with three housemates.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In her 6 episode Netflix series, I am Georgina (Soy Georgina), the love of Cristiano’s life tells about how, early on in their relationship, she would travel to work by bus and then be picked up at the end of her work day by the Portuguese striker in his Bugatti.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/th-image-template-8-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Breaking Down Lionel Messi's Massive $600 Million Net Worth</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Lionel Messi has consistently been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world, earning millions of dollars each year in salary and bonuses.</span><p>Since then, she’s gone from selling luxury items to owning them. Her relationship with one of the most famous men in the world has meant people want to know more about the woman he loves. And the fans adore her, especially because they say despite her rags-to-riches story, she’s stayed grounded. Speaking on I Am Georgina about her good fortune, she says: <strong>“I don’t think I’m a phenomenon, but I do think I’m a lucky woman.”</strong></p><p>Today she often appears as a model, has her own clothing line, and is an internet influencer with over 53.4 million Instagram followers. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Georgina has a net worth of over $10 million</a>. And even though her money pales significantly compared to Ronaldo’s, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she bought him a Rolls-Royce for Christmas</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=georgina-and-cristiano-are-devoted-parents>Georgina And Cristiano Are Devoted Parents</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/cristiano-ronaldo-georgina-rodriguez-and-cristiano-ronaldo-junior.jpg><p>From the start of their relationship, it’s been obvious that they love being a family.

The identity of the soccer icon’s eldest son’s biological mother has been kept secret since his birth in the US. Twins Eva and Matteo were born 7 years later via a surrogate mother. As with their brother, the identity of the twin’s mother has been kept secret. Just weeks after the twins' arrival, the couple announced that Rodriguez was expecting Ronaldo's fourth child: Alana Martina was born on November 12 of the same year.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/irina-shayk-s-popularity-plummeted-after-her-breakup-to-cristiano-ronaldo.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Irina Shayk's Popularity Plummeted After Her Breakup To Cristiano Ronaldo</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Irina Shayk lost millions of online followers within hours after posting about her breakup with Cristiano Ronaldo.</span><p>In October 2021 the couple announced that they were expecting twins. Sadly, Bella Esmeralda was the only one of the pair to survive. Ronaldo has described the death of their son, Angel, as the worst moment in his life since his father's death. The loss has reportedly made the couple even closer.</p><p>Their heart-breaking statement read:<strong> "It is with our deepest sadness we have to announce that our baby boy has passed away.

In November 2018, fans went crazy when rumors began circulating that the soccer icon had proposed to Rodriguez. This after she posted a picture on Instagram, sporting a huge diamond ring. The post was deleted shortly after, and the couple did not respond to the speculation.</p><p>Two years later, another of Georgina’s posts had fans<strong> </strong>excited when she placed an image of herself and Ronaldo taken while they were on holiday in Ibiza.
