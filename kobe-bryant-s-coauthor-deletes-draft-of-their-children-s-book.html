“You were more than a great player, dear Kobe Bryant. I learned a lot by interacting with you,” the Alchemist author tweeted on Sunday, January 26. “Will delete the draft right now, this book has lost its reason.”
Coelho also shared a screenshot of his messages with the late NBA star from August 2019."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The basketball legend and wife <strong><a href=#>Vanessa Bryant</a> </strong>shared<a href=#> four daughters:</a> Natalia, 17, Gianna, Bianka, 3, and Capri, 7 months.</p><p>Coelho further explained his decision not move forward with the book plans on Monday, January 27.</p><p>“I deleted the draft because it didn’t make any sense to publish without him,” the Brazilian lyricist told the Associated Press. “It wouldn’t add anything relevant to him or his family.”</p><p>Coelho added that he may write about his experiences with Kobe in the future.</p><p>“That doesn’t stop me from writing someday about things I learned from Kobe and how much of a larger-than-life person he was,” he explained. “But the children’s book did not make sense anymore. … I saw him enough times to assure he had much more than sports on his mind, it wasn’t all about competition.”</p><p>The author concluded: “His tragic death has shown already how he was important to the world, not only to the United States. We will discuss his legacy for many years, much beyond sport.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Coelho isn’t the only person who was working with Kobe before his untimely passing. Actress <a href=#><strong>Olivia Munn</strong> revealed she was set to meet with him this week</a> “to brainstorm more parts of the epic world you were creating” at his multi-media original content company, Granity Studios.</p><p>“You were creating a whole big world from scratch- everything from the continents to the oceans and rivers to the trees and even the leaves on the trees,” Munn wrote on Monday via Instagram. “The last time we talked, I told you my idea about what the night sky would be made of. I was inspired by friends of mine who lost their 4-year-old daughter to cancer. … ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣We wanted to help kids be less afraid of death and tell stories of all the little and big stars…. And now you’re one of them. 😞⭐️⁣⁣⁣”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakp5KaeqO%2B2JqlratdmLyiwdOhpqtllJq5psDErGSdqpGbwW67xWaroZ2Zp3qktMilm6udnqh6o7vOpGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
