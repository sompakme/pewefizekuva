With a net worth of $160 million,<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"> Steph Curry</a> plays with the Golden State Warriors and went on to win the NBA Championship in 2015, 2017, 2018 and 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Curry is the NBA’s all-time leader in three-pointers and is considered one of the greatest players of all time.</p><p>Critics say the basketball star was drastically underpaid at the start of his career and had no notable endorsements, but Curry has made up for it now. In 2023, he is one of the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">highest-paid athletes in the world</a> with a $50 million salary with the NBA and another $40 million through endorsements like <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Under Armour</a>, Subway, State Farm and CarMax.</p><p>Here’s how Curry spends his fortune today.</p><h2 id=unanimous-media>Unanimous Media</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Curry owns his own media company, Unanimous Media. According to the <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">website,</a> NBCUniversal has inked a multi-year global talent partnership deal and the multi-media business produces shows like Level UP, Black Pop and perhaps most popular, Holey Moley, a golf game show on ABC. The 2023 film Why Not Us, featured on ESPN+ highlights student athletes and the challenges and importance of sports programs for youth. In fact, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Curry</a> hopes to continue developing diverse voices through <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">authors</a>, artists and others in a new venture under the Unanimous Media umbrella, Pathways Alliance.</p><h2 id=success-in-the-family>Success in the Family</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Curry has been married to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Ayesha Alexander </a>since 2011. The couple have three children: Riley, Ryan and Cannon. His wife has become a business mogul in her own right. She has appeared on numerous cooking shows, published a variety of cookbooks and started a pop-up restaurant. Sweet July is Alexander’s food and <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">lifestyle brand </a>and Curry is behind his wife through it all. While the family is successful in a variety of ways, it also takes a solid investment to reach these levels.</p><h2 id=traveling-abroad>Traveling Abroad</h2><p>Of course, the entire family is seen across the country, attending various NBA games and championships and even sitting on dad’s lap during press conferences. Part of a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">luxurious lifestyle is traveling</a> pretty much anywhere you want to go. The Curry’s like to travel to exotic locations from remote islands to other countries like Ireland and Italy. In 2023, the couple posted photos from Fiji and took a 10-year anniversary trip to Mnemba Island.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">A Peek Inside Former NBA Star Dwyane Wade 's Car Collection</a></span></p><h2 id=inside-the-garage>Inside the Garage</h2><p>The NBA star loves luxurious vehicles and keeps a collection of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">top-of-the-line cars</a> in his garage. He has a 2017 Porsche 911 GT3 RS, valued at nearly $190,000, a Porsche Panamera Turbo S for $150,000 and a 2018 Infiniti Q50 in his collection. Though he clearly has a love for German vehicles, Curry purchased a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Tesla</a>, valued at more than $90,000; a mid-size sedan with falcon wing doors. As the family continues to grow, they’ve purchased a Range Rover and he admits, this is his favorite car to drive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luxury-watches>Luxury Watches</h2><p>Curry is a fan of luxury watches and owns a <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">variety of collectibles</a>. For instance, his Panerai PAM01441 Luminor GMT is worth an estimated $15,000. Other watches in his collection include a Rolex Sea-Dweller Deepsea ($20,000), a Cartier Santos 100 ($15,000) and a Cartier Santos Skeleton, estimated at $57,000 to name a few. With a net worth like Curry’s, a bit of <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">expensive fashion and flair </a>never hurt anyone.</p><h2 id=real-estate>Real Estate</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple have <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">purchased numerous homes</a> over the years. The Californians bought a $3.2 million home in Walnut, CA and a $5.775 million mansion in Alamo, CA. In 2019, Curry bought a $31 million mansion in Atherton on 1.2 acres with separate guest house and sold it for $31.15 million two years later. Today, they own a $30 million, 18,000 square foot mansion in Atherton on two acres. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, they also purchased a $2.1 million home in Winter Park, FL just last year, sparking questions about the location and the Curry’s interest in Florida.</p><h2 id=amateur-golfer>Amateur Golfer</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It’s no surprise that golfing is one of the most expensive amateur and professional games out there. When Curry is not on the court, we’ll likely find him on the golf course. He’s played alongside pro golfers like <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Phil Mickelson</a> and Collin Morikawa and is often seen on the course with former president Barack Obama. According to <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">INSIDER</a>, ESPN’s Michael Collins once suggested Curry could make the PGA Tour due to his skill and interest in the game. Curry also runs the Underrated Golf tour, with the focus to increase golf involvement among diverse communities. He has also donated $1 million to the Howard University golf program.</p><h2 id=charity-investments>Charity Investments</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Curry and his wife launched the Eat.Learn.Play Foundation in 2019. The nonprofit focuses on childhood education and healthy lifestyles. The family is <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">investing in nutrition</a>, education and physical activity for children in their school, at home and in their neighborhoods of Oakland, the Bay Area and across the country. For example, Eat.Learn.Play Foundation has invested in local sports programming in schools and recreational leagues in the community and is planning the remodel of more than a dozen <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">high-traffic play areas</a> throughout Oakland. They’ve donated over 500,000 books and 25 million meals across their hometown.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Here's How NBA Star Chris Paul Earns And Spends His $160 Million Fortune</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Unanimous Media</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, <a href=# rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">INSIDER</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8eeqZ6rXZ28uHnNm5hmq6SWv26%2F056noZ2eYrC2vtGyZKyolaOxtHnHoqpmqpmYtaa%2Fjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
