Although not much is known about her family, siblings, early childhood and parents; we do know that Sarah was a precocious teenager and was quite versed in political issues from a young age. Her interest will go on to shape her future career as a reporter and investigative journalist par excellence.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-achievements></span><strong>Career Achievements</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Westwood started off on her journalism career quite early.

Shortly after her internship, she took up a job as an investigative journalist and reporter for the Washington Examiner in 2014. While there, Westwood spent much of her time covering critical political issues including fraud and abuse in government. In 2016, however, her duties soon shifted to “White House Correspondence” for the news agency.</p><p>As her profile increased, she became a resource person and occasionally revisits the National Journalism Centre to provide training and mentorship for her colleagues in training. Asides that, Sarah Westwood’s career has enabled her to appear in high-profile news programs and channels like MSNBC, CNN and Fox News. As of the time of writing, she works as a White House Correspondence for CNN. But there’s more to the young and talented journalist.</p><p>Her career has exposed her to several notable achievements. In 2015, she won the “Robert Novak Journalism Scholarship.” With a grant of $140,000, the fellowship enabled Westwood and six other journalists undertake a yearlong writing project focusing on free enterprise, American culture, and the democratic society.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sarah-westwoods-salary-and-net-worth></span> <strong>Sarah Westwood’s </strong><strong>Salary and Net Worth</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Although Sarah Westwood’s salary and net worth have not been shared or published on an official site, we’re aware that the average salary of a CNN correspondent dangles between $87,249 and $188,213, annually.
