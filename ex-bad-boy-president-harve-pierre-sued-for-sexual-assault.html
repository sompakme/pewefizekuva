Pierre engaged in a year-long pattern of grooming plaintiff, leading to sexual harassment of plaintiff, and sexual assault.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The lawsuit points to 2016 and 2017 as key years that the ex-Bad Boy boss allegedly sexually assaulted her. Harve’s actions allegedly left her with physical injuries, and emotional and mental trauma. Doe is seeking undisclosed damages that she believes will “fully and fairly compensate” her.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Additionally, Bad Boy Entertainment has been named in the suit for their role in neglecting Pierre’s alleged behavior. The suit states that the company failed to “properly supervise” and reprimand the former president. “Defendants knew or should have known that Pierre was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">unfit to be in a position</a> of authority before Pierre sexually assaulted plaintiff,” the suit added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-80299786.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">A Bad Boy spokesperson asserted that they had no idea that such behavior had taken place “many years ago.” However, the company did state they were taking the suit seriously and handling it with “top priority.”&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We have recently become aware of a lawsuit filed in New York by a former employee. The allegations are from many years ago that were never brought to the attention of the company. Neither the plaintiff nor the executive are current employees of the company. We are now investigating the allegations, and our top priority is the safety and well-being of our employees.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Harve Pierre met Sean “<a href=# id=auto-tag_diddy data-tag=diddy>Diddy</a>” Combs when they were both students at Howard. Pierre began working at Bad Boy in 1992. After leaving the company in ’95, he returned to a role as president and served in the role until December 2017.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The lawsuit arrives a week after <a href=# id=auto-tag_cassie data-tag=cassie>Cassie</a> Ventura <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>filed her groundbreaking suit</a> against Diddy. Ventura accused the music legend of repeated physical abuse for over a decade, sex trafficking, sexual battery,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>sexual assault</a>, and violations of New York City’s gender-motivated violence law. Days later, Cassie and Diddy reached a settlement for an&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>undisclosed amount</a> of money. The full terms of the settlement also remain confidential.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/GettyImages-82475182.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5eupXnBqLBmoJGnw6Z5z6Kcq6qVYsCmxNSao2aZo6iutrjTZmhra2RtfneAkm1m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
