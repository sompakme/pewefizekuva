He allegedly started dating his current wife before his divorce was finalized.</p><p>Additionally, the questions about fidelity have further been fueled after Reynolds <a href=#>confessed he and Blake were both on a double date</a> with other people before realizing their mutual attraction, indicating a somewhat unconventional start to their relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/blake-lively-was-applauded-for-calling-herself-out-after-kate-middleton-s-heartbreaking-announcement-front-back-deposit.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Blake Lively Was Applauded For Calling Herself Out After Kate Middleton's Heartbreaking Announcement">Blake Lively Was Applauded For Calling Herself Out After Kate Middleton's Heartbreaking Announcement</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Blake Lively made the right choice, apologizing for a post about Kate Middleton that did not age well.</p><p>Moreover, some fans got the ick after Ryan candidly admitted he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">basically begged Lively to sleep with him</a> at the beginning, only to subsequently suggest buying a house together within a week of their relationship, leading some fans to question whether their relationship has largely been impulsive.</p><p>Moreover, there have been reports that the couple often live separate lives, despite sharing four children. Coupled with their humorous but sometimes pointed social media exchanges, hint at potential underlying tensions. Moreover, fans were also irked when Blake was upset that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ryan apparently bought a soccer team without her input.</a></p><p>Despite the so-called controversy, Blake and Ryan continue to stand the test of time since tying the knot in 2012, as evidenced by Lively’s sweet show of support for Reynolds on socials this week.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZpZmbmnqttdWeo7JllJq7qrHSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWgp7yjuMSmqmaon6jBqrrGZqOorpViu7DAxGapspmeYr%2Bmxc2oo52rXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
