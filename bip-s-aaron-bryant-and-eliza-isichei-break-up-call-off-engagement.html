You’re the most beautiful part of Paradise for me. I know I have these feelings for you because I pay attention to every little thing you do,” Aaron told Eliza, before getting down on one knee. “We went through so much. Couples shouldn’t last that, honestly, but we found a way to choose each other and choose faith in one another. I’m so happy right now to be standing here with you and to talk about the future as well.”</p><p>Before popping the question, Aaron admitted he spoke to Eliza’s mom.</p><p>“She is very proud of you, she thinks the most of you.
