If the fact that it has a name doesn't tip one off to its over-the-top opulence, then the layout will.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The gorgeous villa is not only breathtaking on a level most never encouter, but it is the snapshot of natural beauty. Covered in vines of wisteria and overlooking Nice, the windows show a view unlike any other. With over 10,000-square feet of pure comfort and amenities, Sean's former home features an indoor pool, a gym, spa, and and unbeatable kitchen. Whatever is cooked inside can be enjoyed outside as an outdoor dining terrace gives both residents and guests a chance to dine while overlookingthe Mediterranean Sea.&nbsp;Suddenly, that $33.9 million is starting to make more and more sense.</p><p>The home was originally purchased by Connery following his 1970s marriage to Micheline Roquebrune in the 1970s. The pair, according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, occupied the estate for close to 12 years and remained together until Sean's passing on Halloween 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time of his passing, Connery's net worth was around&nbsp;$350 million. His film roles, while most notably James Bond, included many unforgettable parts including cinematic classics, like Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. One of his final parts was in 2003’s The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. &nbsp;The action film based on the graphic novel may not have been well-received at the time, but has come to pick up a strong following in the years since. Many have speculated that the poor reception lead to his retirement in 2006.</p><p>A representative for Knight Frank real estate consultants told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a> that La Roc Fleuri has been on the market since before Halloween last year and is still available for purchase.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Daniel Craig Shares His Advice For The Next James Bond Actor</a></span></p><p>Sources:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheatsheet</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTApq3NZpqopp6av7p5yZqknqtdl7yvsIyvoKWkkWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
