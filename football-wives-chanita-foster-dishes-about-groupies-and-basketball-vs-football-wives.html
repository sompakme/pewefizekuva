We shared jokes about him being from Denver and eventually he asked me, ‘Do you want to date me or work for me?’ I was focused on work so I said work for him, but he asked me to go on one date, and the rest is history.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>What do you consider a groupie?<br><span>A woman who wants a man based solely on his job. There are women who are doctors and lawyers, and are still groupies. Women try and lie and say it’s a preference, but what are the thoughts and choices factored in to have that ‘preference?’ It makes sense for a woman who is some type of athlete to have that preference, maybe because they are looking for someone who can relate to their own athletic lifestyle. But women who never dribbled a ball in their life and want to date someone just because they are an athlete, that’s a groupie.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>What do you think is the major difference between being a football wife versus a basketball wife?<br><span>The payout. Money difference is huge, you can’t even put us in the same category. If someone is driving a Bentley in the NFL they are 1 of 4 percent; NBA players have 100 percent guaranteed money. In the NFL, the payout is more incentive based.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>What about all the cheating we hear comes with dating an athlete?<br><span>A basketball wife has more opportunities to get cheated on than a football wife. The NBA has 84 games a year, that’s 42 opportunities [for a basketball player] to do what they want in another city. The NFL has a total of 16 games, and eight of them you leave on Saturday, play, and come back on Sunday. Basketball players can have a game, and then too much time and opportunity to be promiscuous, especially in cities like LA, Miami, and Atlanta where they arrive a week and a half before they have to play.</span></span></strong></p><p><strong><span>Is being a wife of an athlete over glamorized?<br><span>On the show, people don’t want to talk about the things that are real. I may be the girl that can walk into a boardroom and negotiate million dollar deals, but I’m from Detroit. I want to relate to real people, and show where I’m from, [that] you can come from anything and be successful. I love my husband. I wouldn’t trade my husband, my kids, or my life for anyone’s 50,000 square foot house, their last name, and all the misery that comes with it for nothing in the world. I promise you.</span></span></strong></p><p><span>Read the full interview at </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>Black Voices</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u8sMDBmqOlZaeew6a%2FjJyfmqaZqa5uss6sq56qXZm2tLTErGSamp%2BqwW6z0aisqaGVqHqiusNmmZqrm5rBo63LpWSvq12bvLDAwZqjpWWnnsOmv4xubHJpZmQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
