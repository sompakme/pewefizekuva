After all, since many stars get their big-screen acting debut when they're quite young, early retirement isn't a new fad. And, well, singers can't necessarily perform all over the world tirelessly for years either. So, which celebrities completed a semi-retirement? Find out below.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nicole-39-snooki-39-polizzi><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi</span></h2><p>In case you didn't know, Jersey Shore and "GTL" are still a thing! Yes, all these years later and the Italian-American New Jersey crew are still letting us into their wild and adventurous lives filled with drama, popcorn, tanning and alcohol.</p><p>Well, our favorite little meatball once packed up her suitcase and vouched she would never return to the spotlight. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">In December 2019, Snooki released the statement, "I have to do whatâ€™s best for me at the moment, and I am retiring from Jersey Shore."</a> As a busy mother-of-three, the actress didn't stay home too long before she got the itch! Just two years later, she returned full-time for the fifth season of the show, Jersey Shore: Family Vacation. Can we get a fist pump, please?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=adrian-grenier><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Adrian Grenier</span></h2><p>Have you binge-watched Netflix's newest drama miniseries Clickbait yet? Plot twist: Adrian Grenier had actually quit acting and just reappeared.</p><p>The face we know all too well because of his role on Entourage isn't one we've seen for numerous years now. Did you notice that he made a run from the Hollywood lights? The heartthrob we know as Vincent Chase left his fame behind for a self-sufficient life on a farm. In an interview with Austin Life, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grenier spoke of his other life goals, citing his reason of departure as permanently moving to Texas to pursue farming.</a> He's living the simple life as a farmer, but Grenier suddenly emerged on our Netflix screens.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>The Real Reason Adrian Grenier Now Lives Off The Map</a></span></p><h2 id=barbra-streisand><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Barbra Streisand</span></h2><p>No matter the path Babs decides to take for the rest of her days, she'll forever be an icon.</p><p>With over sixty albums to her name, she certainly is entitled to retirement right now, but that's not the case for the unstoppable Barbra Streisand. However, back in 1999, at the end of her Timeless tour, the highest-selling female recording artist of all time announced she was done with singing and performing. However, it wasn't long before she came to her senses and returned to the stage where she evidently belongs, in 2006.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shia-labeouf><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Shia LaBeouf</span></h2><p>We know his lovable face from Even Stevens as we'd rush home to watch it way back when, but Shia LaBeouf strayed off the path later on in bizarre ways.</p><p>With Transformer and other big roles, the actor got caught up in some unacceptable off-screen incidents. Instead of getting help and continuing his successful career, he announced in 2014 that he was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"retiring from public life."</a></p><p>His continuous odd behavior and involvement in scandals didn't stop after his "retirement" though.
