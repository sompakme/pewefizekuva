She's everywhere; on the radio, climbing up the streaming charts, on Twitter, and even on the VMAs stage (as a host, no less). So it wasn't entirely surprising when the artist released a makeup line this fall with BH Cosmetics.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After all, Doja Cat has previously shown off her makeup chops in her Instagram snaps, music videos, and on the red carpet at various venues. But looking back at her headline-making history in recent months, fans have to wonder whether she's been planning this makeup launch for longer than anyone realized.</p><h2 id=doja-cat-went-makeup-free-over-the-summer>Doja Cat Went Makeup-Free Over The Summer</h2><p>Over the summer of 2021, Doja Cat attracted plenty of attention by releasing her newest album, Planet Her. The galactic-themed release spawned tons of fun IG content, and even <a href=#>a music video featuring Grimes</a> (among other friends of Cat's) that was absolutely a wonder of special effects makeup.</p><p>But what also happened over the summer was some content that featured a very different-looking Doja, according to fans. When Doja Cat appeared makeup-free on her social media, fans were, well, shook.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In fact, many stated that <a href=#>Doja Cat was unrecognizable in her no-makeup look</a>, going so far as to say that the artist was catfishing literally everyone because her bare face was so different than that of her fully-made-up one.</p><p>It's not a new accusation, to be fair, in that most female artists are often criticized for how different they look with versus without makeup. A lot of the time, they're even criticized for wearing too much makeup and not looking like themselves at all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Doja Cat definitely doesn't seem to care what critics and trolls have to say about her, some wonder whether the no-makeup look she sported was merely a publicity stunt.</p><p>Because not long after she went bare-faced on social media and spurred all kinds of critical headlines, Doja Cat partnered with a cosmetics company and released a bunch of her own goodies that could rival Kylie's makeup collection.</p><h2 id=doja-cat-x-bh-cosmetics-released-in-the-fall>Doja Cat x BH Cosmetics Released In The Fall</h2><p>In late September, Doja Cat's collab with BH Cosmetics went live, and she shared promos on her Instagram to celebrate. Fans celebrated with her ahead of the launch, commenting on her IG about how prolific Doja Cat has been with her partnerships lately.</p><p>First Pepsi and then Candy Crush Saga, they noted, and then a makeup launch directly after. Various fans congratulated Doja on 'getting that bag' and called her "an icon."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Thinking back to earlier in the summer, though, it almost seems as if Doja Cat's no-makeup selfies and videos were sort of building up to her makeup launch moment. After all, if Doja Cat can glow up with a face full of products, what's to stop her fans from doing the same?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's How Doja Cat Amassed Her Reported $4 Million Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Of course, Doja Cat looks just fine without her products slathered on, but in her industry, it's a "thing" for artists to constantly have their game faces on 24/7, which is part of why fans were shocked to see her bare-faced earlier on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this point, it seems like maybe she was making a statement about how much makeup can change a person's look, to support the fact that maybe her new makeup line is just plain bangin', and fans should buy what she wears to glow up the same way.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Doja Cat Reveals Who She Wants To Collaborate With Next</a></span></p><p>Plus, her press release literally recalled her first foray into makeup, which Doja stated was with BH Cosmetics.</p><p>In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">press release</a>, Doja noted that the collab was "such a full circle moment" for her, and that "one of the first shadow palettes" she ever purchased was from BH. And fortunately for fans, all the creative pieces, including calligraphy eyeliners and 36 eyeshadow colors, are available "for a very reasonable price."</p><p>All the cosmetics in Doja's collab are apparently vegan and cruelty free, and the prices don't seem too painful; $36 for the eyeshadow palette seems decent enough. But what do fans who've bought the products think so far?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-do-fans-think-about-doja-cat-x-bh-cosmetics>What Do Fans Think About Doja Cat x BH Cosmetics?</h2><p>While plenty of people seem to be buying Doja Cat's products (at least, they promised to in her Instagram comments), not everyone is thrilled. Like any other celebrity makeup product (or any product) release, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BH Cosmetics palettes</a> don't have the best reviews.</p><p>One reviewer even noted that just because an artist is popular doesn't mean their makeup products will be all that. And some seemingly honest reviews stated that the products were above-average quality, but that they expected a bit more from something with Doja Cat's name and face on them.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Ariana Grande's (Almost) Perfect Response To Critics Of Her Makeup Line</a></span></p><p>Other shoppers reviewing Doja's eyeliners had less thrilling feedback; some reviewers stated that Doja herself didn't seem to like the eyeliner, based on her IG Live demo of the products, and another stated that the eyeliner was "chalky."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But the question is, would any of those fans have bought Doja's makeup if they hadn't seen her work her magic with her looks first?</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>A Full Timeline Of Doja Cat's Rise To Fame</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibopxdmbyrrYycmK2rXaO8brnApJyuqF2hvLC3jKGcpahdqLKtuIyhnKtlnprEbrnApJyuqF2htq%2Bxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
