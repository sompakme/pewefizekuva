He also requested Richardson to let him see if her cell phone was in flight mode.</p><p><strong>“Following that while standing in front of me doing the safety protocols he continued to lean over to look at my phone,”</strong> Richardson said in an Instagram story tagging American Airlines. <strong>“He asked to see that my phones were in airplane mode at this point. He demanded that I show him. Which I did in front of him.”</strong></p><p>Richardson got into an argument with one of the flight attendants when they asked her to put her cell phone in flight mode. She couldn’t tolerate the attendant peeking into her phone and started arguing with him.</p><p>Things got heated up when Sha’Carri started recording the behavior of the flight attendant.&nbsp;The crew members asked her to put down her phone to which she resisted and said that she is trying to record her own video.</p><p>Sha’Carri stated,<strong> “I definitely would have listened to instructions but the way he was talking to me was very unprofessional, and then his hands were all in my face.”</strong></p><p>A few minutes later, Richardson was spotted being approached by a flight attendant who informed her that she must get off the aircraft.<strong> “The captain wants you off the plane,”</strong> was the justification for the decision.</p><p><strong>“Does the captain know what occurred before you took me out? Do they understand that this man was rude to me and that his hands were in my face and I feel unsafe?</strong></p><p>Richardson felt that it was unreasonable that the captain instructed her to leave the plane due to his “<strong>disrespectful</strong>” behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Clapping can be heard in her footage as she exits the plane because of the incident, which led to several people missing their connecting flights.</p><p>A spokesperson for the same airline company said that they accommodated the customer on another flight, and a member of the investigation team has reached out to learn more about what happened.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2Fx5pknJmip7Zuvsicn5qqlKi8r3nFpaCgoKRirrXAxKebmqakZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
