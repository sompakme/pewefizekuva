After being treated to opening sets from Vince Staples, the Internet and <a href=# id=auto-tag_chance-the-rapper_3 data-tag=chance-the-rapper>Chance the Rapper</a>, the main attraction took to the stage declaring the volume he likes his music played with his hit song “Loud.”</p><p>While there were plenty of thrills in store, Mac’s performance consisted of no gaudy chains, no posse to accompany him on stage and none of the antics he portrays on his Most Dope TV show.</p><p>It was all about the music.</p><p>With his blue overalls rolled up to his calves, a buttoned-up shirt and a flimsy black baseball cap, Mac continued his set with another track off of Macadellic, the Juicy J assisted “Lucky Ass Bitch.”</p><p>Just a month after releasing his second studio album Watching Movies With The Sound Off, concertgoers seemed to know every word to Mac’s tunes off the album. Beginning with “Red Dot Music,” the Pittsburgh-native weaved through songs from his latest album, calling on a number of his friends to help him along the way.</p><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_schoolboy-q_3 data-tag=schoolboy-q>Schoolboy Q</a> was the first rapper to hit the stage with Mac, briefly appearing to perform “Gees” side-by-side. Next, Q’s Black Hippy cohort Ab Soul would join Mac for their song “Matches.”</p><p>The special guests continued as OFWGKTA spitter <a href=# id=auto-tag_earl-sweatshirt_3 data-tag=earl-sweatshirt>Earl Sweatshirt</a> came out to assist Mac with his feature on the album, “I’m Not Real.”</p><p>Bouncing from the album to mixtapes and other projects in his repertoire, Mac followed a playful performance of “Nikes on My Feet” with a skillful guitar session. Plucking the chords to “The Question” solo, the 21-year-old instrumentalist wasn’t quite finished on the night. Mac would entertain attendees by hopping in the drums and even the piano. His melodic performance of “Youforia,” sobered the mood in the venue. With fans chanting “we want more,” Mac would answer their request by performing the track that catapulted his success, “Donald Trump.”</p><p>As the crowd filed out, it was apparent Mac had conducted an out-of-this-world experience. The Space Migration Tour continues tonight in Connecticut at the Oakdale theater. —Christopher Harris</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6eypK3PZqSam12itq24xKtkq6eToMBuuticZKyokZiybrnIoKmarJmku27Azq6pZqukpL1uw8itn2aroJqwqq3LZp6unaOpwG59lXFpaW9f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
