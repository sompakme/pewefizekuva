We know two things to be truthful. First, the Golden State Warriors situation with Draymond Green and Jordan Poole was always going to get uglier before it got prettier. And second, when there’s a big story on the internet, it doesn’t take long for Jake Paul to get involved.
The following the circulation of a viral clip that saw NBA star Draymond Green landing a clean knockout punch of teammate Jordan Poole on friday, Paul tweeted about the incident and not only seemed impressed with Green’s punching power, but went as far as to make a lucrative offer for the former Defensive Player of the Year to box under his Most Valuable Promotions banner."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The YouTube celebrity, who now has five professional boxing matches under his belt (all wins, but all against non-boxers), made his professional debut in 2020 against fellow YouTuber AnEsonGib. But his second fight? A bout against former Warrior Nate Robinson, which ended in a second-round knockout win for Paul, per <a href=#><i>Golden State of Mind.</i></a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn’t sound like Paul — whose next fight is scheduled for later this month against retired UFC legend Anderson Silva — wants to fight Green, just get him to box under the banner of his promotion, which was founded in 2021.</p><p>Green has a reputation as both one of the greatest defensive players in NBA history and one of the sport’s most notorious agitators, so it wouldn’t be surprising to see the 32-year-old strap on the gloves especially if Paul’s offer is even remotely serious.</p><p>As for “The Problem Child,” he is set to fight UFC legend <a href=#>Anderson Silva</a> in a boxing bout that serves as the headline of a Showtime pay-per-view event on Oct. 29 in Glendale, Ariz.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This is all incredibly silly, of course, but it’s the age of the internet that we’re in. And hopefully it can provide a little levity in light of a very ugly situation. But don’t worry: we won’t be seeing Green in a boxing ring any time soon. And hopefully we won’t be seeing him throwing any more punches any time soon, either.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT:</b><a href=#><b>Demi Lovato Had To Postponed Her Illinois Concert After Loses Her Voice As She Woke Up</b></a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>MMA Fighting</a>, <a href=#>Golden State of Mind.</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS3orfEZqearZxivKeyxKuqZqaSlnq0wMCrZJ2qka66sLrDZp6rnZWjeqe70WaZqLCZo7RuucCtmqFllqS%2Fbn2PZqSipJyevK97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
