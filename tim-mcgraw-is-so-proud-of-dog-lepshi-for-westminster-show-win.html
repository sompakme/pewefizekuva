The annual event is<a href=#> a competition for purebred dogs</a>, where judges watch pups from all background<a href=#>s show off their best tricks</a>. The competition marked the first time that there was a specific category for the Italian hunting breed.</p><p class=p1>“He’s a wonderful ambassador for the breed,” Lepshi’s handler, <strong>Ryan Wolfe</strong>, told the <a href=#>Associated Press</a> of the 6-year-old canine. “Lepshi aces the breed’s trademark ground-covering trot [and] he loves everybody.”</p><p class=p1>After Lepshi won his category, the pup moved on to the semifinal round before he was ultimately eliminated.</p><p class=p1>Several of McGraw’s famous friends applauded the pup’s achievement. <a href=#><strong>Rita Wilson</strong></a> replied “wow” while <a href=#><strong>Garrett Hedlund</strong></a> — who previously asked the&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Blind Side</a>&nbsp;</i>star to be<a href=#> his and ex <strong>Emma Roberts</strong>’ son Rhodes’ godfather</a> — sent three red heart emojis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Tim-McGraw-Is-So-Proud-of-Dog-Lepshi-for-Winning-Best-in-Breed-at-Westminster-Kennel-Club-Dog-Show-2.jpg><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<a href=#><i>1883&nbsp;</i>actor</a> — along with his wife, <a href=#><strong>Faith Hill</strong> </a>— have owned several Bracco Italiano dogs through the years. In addition to Lepshi, the pair <a href=#>currently share pups Caesar and Stromboli</a>.</p><p class=p1>“He’s a glorified bird dog is all he is,” McGraw quipped of Stromboli during an August 2020 appearance on&nbsp;<i>T<a href=#>he Kelly Clarkson Show</a></i>. “I think he’s called an Italian Bracco. We had a family of those dogs and he’s the last one left [and] we named them all Italian names [because of their breed].”</p><p class=p1>After host <a href=#><strong>Kelly Clarkson</strong></a> further gushed over footage of Stromboli singing with <a href=#>McGraw’s daughter Maggie</a>, the country crooner replied: “To be fair, he sings a lot better than me. I’m probably the worst singer in the house.”</p><p class=p1>McGraw and Hill, 55, later welcomed Lepshi <a href=#>into their brood</a> before he eventually joined the competitive circuit.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>In addition to being proud puppy parents, McGraw and Hill have <a href=#>had their hands full raising daughters</a> Gracie, 26, Maggie, 24, and Audrey, 21.</p><p class=p1>“They’re all completely different creatures, but they all have big hearts,” the “Just to See You Smile” singer gushed to&nbsp;<i><a href=#>Good Morning America</a>&nbsp;</i>in June 2022. “They are all very polite and they really respect people, and they all feel like they wanna make a difference in the world. Hopefully, we’ve instilled that into them.”</p><p class=p1>He added at the time: “I think we see each other in all three of ‘em. There’s little parts of us in all three of ‘em. … We’ve always also given them the opportunity to sort of explore themselves and find out who they are and try things.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatoZ1iuqSz0ZquZqGjYsCwec%2Brpq6cXaSzbrDOoGSlnaCotap5xaipZq%2BVqMGutc2sq56qXai1sMOMsKCnZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
