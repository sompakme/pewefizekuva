He was born to parents Charles and Seryl Kushner, who are major names in the world of finance. The Kushner family is well-known across the United States and has a tight inner circle, mainly made up of those living in Manhattan. While we haven't heard much of the youngest son, Joshua, that all changed after he married the world-renowned fashion model, Karlie Kloss. The two were<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> first romantically linked back in 2012,</a> and dated for well over 5 years before saying their "I do's".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This caused quite the controversy amongst fans of Kloss' as the Kushner's are close friends and business partners with the Trumps, so much that Joshua's older brother, Jared, married Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka Trump, back in 2009. This led many to believe that Karlie and Joshua held the same political beliefs as their in-laws, however, that doesn't appear to be the case.</p><p>Karlie has made it very clear that she and her hubby, Joshua, do not see eye-to-eye with her in-laws when it comes to politics. Karlie made this revelation on Andy Cohen's 'Watch What Happens Live', and further showcased her admiration for the Democratic party after posting an 'I Voted' pic on her Instagram earlier in November.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Fans Comment On Karlie Kloss' Instagram Photo, Investigating The Meaning Of Taylor Swift's 'Betty'</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As for Joshua himself, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the financier is worth a whopping $800 million</a>! He made his fortune thanks to his family's real estate portfolio, which is set to be worth well over $7 billion. As for his own personal accomplishments, Joshua appears to have done it all. After graduating from Harvard University, Kushner went on to work at Goldman Sachs, where he used his experience there to then create Thrive Capital in 2009. This didn't mark the end of Joshua's business ventures.</p><p>He later went on to become the co-founder of Oscar Insurance and Cadre, which works directly with high net worth investors with a lot of real estate to work with. It is no secret that Joshua and his family name have done wonders for him, however, his work ethic is what ultimately made him as successful as he is today.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>This 'That '70s Show' Star Once Dated Ivanka Trump</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBut8Cro6KdXaC5sL%2FSZp%2Buq5KWu6V5yaiqoa2RYri2v8ennKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
