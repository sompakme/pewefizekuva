Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is the film based on the serial killer’s life and recently the actor sat down with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Tonight</a> to share some details about portraying Bundy.</p><p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>ZAC EFFRON SHOWS OFF BIZZARE NEW LOOK</a></strong></p><p>“I didn’t go full method.I didn’t have to do any weird stuff to anybody to get into character,” he shared.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of the reasons he didn’t have to do anything too creepy to get into character is because the film doesn’t focus too much on Bundy’s crimes. Rather the movie focuses on the charismatic side of the man, who would lure his victims with his good looks and charm. The film is from the point of view of his longtime girlfriend, Elizabeth Kloepfer who had a very difficult time accepting Bundy’s true evil nature.</p><p>“It doesn't really glorify Ted Bundy. He wasn't a person to be glorified. It simply tells a story and sort of how the world was able to be charmed over by this guy who was notoriously evil and the vexing position that so many people were put in, the world was put in. It was fun to go and experiment in that realm of reality,” explains <a href=#>Efron</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing the High School Musical alum did have to do was cleanse himself after being in character. Seriously, the actor himself revealed he needed to get rid of Bundy at the end of each day for himself. Can you imagine trying to detach yourself from such a creepy character at the end of the day for months? Thankfully, he had a little help from his friends.</p><p>“I went and had some friends sage me. You know, do a little spiritual cleansing," he revealed and we don’t think he was kidding either.</p><p>The film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile is currently in postproduction but that has not been a release date set yet.</p><p><strong>NEXT: <a href=#>ZAC EFFRON SHOWS OFF HIS TED BUNDY LOOK</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nqpawbrHFn6mopl2YtaK%2BwJyrnqpdqbKlecGupZ2xXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
