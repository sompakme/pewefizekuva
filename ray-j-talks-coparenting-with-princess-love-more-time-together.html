I see the kids every day. Patience, time, love, it heals all.”</p><p>The former couple are planning to celebrate their eldest’s 2nd birthday this weekend. “We’ve been able to spend a little more time together because of the kids,” the <a href=#>Celebrity Big Brother </a>alum explained to Us.</p><p><a href=#>Love gave birth to Melody</a> and Epik in May 2018 and January, respectively, and her estranged husband “loves” being a dad to the&nbsp;two little ones “more than anything.”</p><p>“You start to understand that it’s not a responsibility, it’s connection,” the “Sexy Can I” singer shared with Us. “It’s something you have to do, make sure they’re OK. Being a dad comes with all of the love and all of the care and the protection that we’re supposed to provide for kids.”</p><p>News of his and the Prella Cosmetics’ founder split broke earlier this month when<a href=#> Love filed for divorce after four years of marriage</a>.</p><p>Ray J is “interested” to know how Love feels about his upcoming album, Follow My Lead. He told Us, “I want to play her the whole album because it’s really like a love letter. But I want her to hear first and then let me know what she thinks about it.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The <a href=#>Brandy</a> and Ray J: A Family Business alum’s virtual event was the first look at his single “Stranded,” which will be available to stream and purchase in mid-June.
