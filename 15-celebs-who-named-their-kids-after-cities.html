Whether it’s what they’re wearing to a red carpet event, dating someone unexpected and out of their league, or even going out on a limb on one of their work projects, celebrities are willing to do anything to get people talking about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Celebrities have also been known to name their children some really bizarre names. We’ve seen children named after food, colors, and random objects. We’ve also seen the trend on naming children after places—Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have recently made headlines for naming their newborn baby girl Chicago, after the Windy City.</p><p>Many people look up to celebrities as role models or idols and will try to copy their trends and follow in their footsteps. You can see that when a clothing item sells out because a celebrity wore it or a product flying off the shelves because a celeb endorses it. But, more importantly, it happens with baby names too. We have to admit that some of them are cute and we’d consider naming our own kids that, but some of them are just too crazy and outrageous for us. Whatever keeps their names in the papers, we suppose.&nbsp;These are 15 celebrities who named their kids after cities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west---chicago><strong>Kim Kardashian And Kanye West - Chicago</strong></h2><p>Celebrities are notorious for naming their children strange names, and&nbsp;Kim and Kanye&nbsp; aren't strangers to doing so. Perhaps one of the most famous celebrity children on this list, Chicago West is probably the youngest too. Chicago’s parents are the one and only Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, and she is Kim and Kanye’s third child just born this year on January 15, 2018. Kim and Kanye are no strangers to naming their children some unique names, as their first daughter is named North and their son, Saint. Chicago was born via surrogate unlike her siblings. The couple decided to name their new daughter after the city in Illinois where Kanye grew up. A little unconventional but we do get the meaning behind the name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=marcia-cross-and-tom-mahoney---savannah><strong>Marcia Cross And Tom Mahoney - Savannah</strong></h2><p>Marcia Cross is best known for her role on Desperate Housewives as Bree Van de Kamp. In her acting career, Marcia is a very busy woman. She’s been on television for years before and after Desperate Housewives. She has her hands full at home too. Marcia and her husband, actor Tom Mahoney, welcomed fraternal twin girls on February 20, 2007. The girls, named Eden and Savannah, are already 11 years old. One of the twins, Savannah, shares the same name as the city located in Georgia. When naming her daughter, Marcia said that she just loved the name Savannah in general and not because of the city—she has no connection to the city at all. We do agree that it is a pretty name, though!</p><h2 id=the-game---harlem><strong>The Game - Harlem</strong></h2><p>The Game, also known as Jayceon Terrell Taylor, is an infamous rapper and actor. He’s released eight studio albums and appeared in a number of movies and TV shows such as Waist Deep, Street Kings, and House Arrest. The Game has three children, one of them being named after a city. His first born son is named Harlem, after Harlem, New York. Harlem Caron Taylor was born on June 30, 2003, and he will be turning 15 this year. The Game never revealed why he named his son after Harlem, but he’s the first of two children to be named after a place. His second son is named King, and his daughter is named California, matching her older brother when it comes to location-themed names.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=slash-and-perla-ferrar---london><strong>Slash And Perla Ferrar - London</strong></h2><p>Saul Hudson, also known as Slash, is one of the world’s most famous musicians. He is best known for being the lead guitarist of Guns N’ Roses. Although he achieved his fame in Guns N’ Roses, he’s also known for being a songwriter, record producer, and film producer. Slash has two children with his now-ex, Perla Ferrar. His first born son is named London, after England’s capital city. This wasn’t just a random name for Slash or something that he and Perla liked the sound of. Slash was born in London and spent a majority of his childhood there. At least this celeb had a good reason for naming their child after a city, and in Slash’s case, he didn’t do it for rock star points.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dorit-and-paul-kemsley---phoenix><strong>Dorit And Paul Kemsley - Phoenix</strong></h2><p>Dorit Kemsley is best known for appearing on Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, and she’s made her mark on the franchise. Not only does she star on the show, but she is a successful business woman herself too and is married to Paul Kemsley, a very successful and wealthy English businessman. The couple has two children together, a boy named Jagger and a little girl named Phoenix. Of course, Phoenix shares her name with the west coast city located in Arizona. Dorit never admitted to intentionally naming her daughter after the city or if she just liked the name. Who knows? She could also have a thing for the bird and named little Phoenix after that.</p><h2 id=jason-aldean-and-brittany-kerr---memphis><strong>Jason Aldean And Brittany Kerr - Memphis</strong></h2><p>Jason Aldean had a really tough year—he was in stage performing during the tragic Las Vegas shooting that killed 58 and injured 489. However, after that traumatic event, Jason Aldean had some good in his life. He and wife Brittany Kerr welcomed their newborn son, Memphis, on December 1, 2017. Although Aldean is a country star, he didn’t name his son Memphis for obvious reasons. Like many celebs, he was going for the unique and different factor without going too crazy. He told Entertainment Tonight, “Nothing crazy like a direction. East, West, North, South — none of that stuff. It will be something really cool. Both of us have names that are pretty common, Jason and Brittany, so something that’s unique is our main goal.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=carson-daly-and-siri-pinter---london><strong>Carson Daly And Siri Pinter - London</strong></h2><p>Carson Daly got his start hosting our favorite after-school show, Total Request Live, better known as TRL. That was just the beginning of his career as he went on to host other shows and award shows to having his own late night talk show. Currently, he’s on every morning on The Today&nbsp;Show and host to the hit singing competition&nbsp;The Voice. Carson and his wife, Siri Pinter, have three children together, one of them named London after England’s capital. Unlike other celebrities, Carson has no connection to the city—he’s very much American. He and his wife just happened to like the name London, and it stuck with their baby girl.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mike-tyson-and-lakiha-spicer---milan><strong>Mike Tyson And Lakiha Spicer - Milan</strong></h2><p>Mike Tyson is one of the most famous boxers in the world. Although he’s since retired, back in the day, he was known to be one heck of a boxer, knocking his opponents out in the very first round and even biting off one of their ears. Mike Tyson is also known for things outside of the ring as well, appearing in some movies such as The Hangover. Like the other celebrities on this list, Mike Tyson also has a child named after a city. His daughter is named after Milan, a very popular city located in Italy. It appears that he was also looking for a unique name as he has no connections to the city. We guess he just liked the sound of it!</p><h2 id=jimmy-fallon-and-nancy-juvonen---winnie><strong>Jimmy Fallon And Nancy Juvonen - Winnie</strong></h2><p>Funny man Jimmy Fallon has been making us laugh for years now. Between his time on Saturday Night Live (SNL), movies such as Taxi and Fever Pitch, and now the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, he’s definitely one of the guys to always make us laugh. What many people don’t know is that his daughter, Winnie, is actually named after a place. He and his wife, Nancy Juvonen Fallon, frequented Lake Winnipesaukee and even got engaged there. As a result, they decided to name their daughter after it, going for Winnie for short. We have to commend Jimmy for actually having a sentimental reason for naming his daughter Winnie and not just because it was cool or trendy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=nick-and-vanessa-lachey---camden-brooklyn-and-phoenix><strong>Nick And Vanessa Lachey - Camden, Brooklyn, And Phoenix</strong></h2><p>Nick and Vanessa Lachey have been married since 2011. Nick, a member of the 90’s boy band 98 Degrees, and Vanessa, a model and TV personality, have a total of three children together. The couple definitely outdid themselves since all three of their children share names with cities. Their sons, Camden and Phoenix, don’t really have a connection with the cities that they’re named after. However, the couple did reveal that their daughter, Brooklyn, was named after the city because she was conceived in New York. With the way that these two are naming their kids, if they ever decide to have another, we can definitely expect them to name them after another city yet again. Keep the trend going within the family, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=michael-jackson-and-debbie-rowe---paris><strong>Michael Jackson And Debbie Rowe - Paris</strong></h2><p>Michael Jackson, the King of Pop, needs no formal introduction. He’s made a huge impact on the music world, influencing so many modern artists that we’ve come to know today. The world was shocked when he suddenly passed away in June of 2009. The star has three children in total—two with his former wife Debbie Rowe and his third was via a surrogate after the two divorced. The surrogate has remained anonymous. Jackson’s second child, his one and only daughter, was named after the city of love, Paris. There’s no comment as to why Paris was named after the city in France. Neither one of her parents made a statement&nbsp;about the connection. Michael Jackson traveled all over the world, so perhaps Paris was one of his favorite places. Who knows, right?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=shakira-and-gerard-piqu---milan><strong>Shakira And Gerard Piqué - Milan</strong></h2><p>Shakira, best known for her hit song “Hips Don’t Lie” and her time as a judge on the hit singing competition The Voice, welcomed her first child in January of 2013 with her equally famous soccer-playing husband, Gerard Piqué. Their son, named Milan, shares the name with the very famous city in Italy. The couple really doesn’t have any ties to the city in Italy, and Shakira made it very clear that her son wasn’t named after the city exactly. The couple stated when the baby was born that they went with Milan because it “means dear, loving, and gracious in Slavic; in Ancient Roman, eager and laborious; and in Sanskrit, unification.”</p><h2 id=pete-wentz-and-ashlee-simpson---bronx><strong>Pete Wentz And Ashlee Simpson - Bronx</strong></h2><p>Pete Wentz, bassist of famous band Fall Out Boy, was once married to singer and actress Ashlee Simpson. The two had a son together, born in November of 2008. The couple has since split. When their son was born, he was named Bronx, after the city in New York. Neither Pete nor Ashlee are from New York. Therefore, there was some questioning behind the name. Pete had explained that Bronx was just a name that the then-couple had thrown around and grown to really like. Unfortunately, there’s no real story or connection behind the boy and the city, just another celebrity trying for a cool and trendy name.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwen-stefani-and-gavin-rossdale---zuma><strong>Gwen Stefani And Gavin Rossdale - Zuma</strong></h2><p>We saw Gwen Stefani evolve from her multi-colored hair days in the band No Doubt to flourishing and becoming a very successful solo artist. Gwen was once married to the rhythm guitarist of the band Bush, Gavin Rossdale. The couple had three children together before they ultimately split and finalized their divorce in 2016. One of the couple’s children, Zuma, is actually named after a city—not exactly a common city, that is. They welcomed Zuma in August of 2008, naming him after one of their favorite places, Zuma Beach, California. Zuma certainly isn’t a Paris or Milan, like we’ve seen a few times already, so A+ for creativity on that one!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=david-and-victoria-beckham---brooklyn><strong>David And Victoria Beckham - Brooklyn</strong></h2><p>Britain’s own power couple, made up of soccer star David Beckham and former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, certainly have the gene pool to create some absolutely adorable children. The Beckhams have four children—three boys and one girl. Their oldest son is named Brooklyn, after none other than Brooklyn, New York. The couple decided to name their eldest son after the city because they were in New York when they found out Victoria was pregnant. She also wrote in her book that she liked the place in general. She said, “I’d always like it as a place—it’s very multicultural, very grounded. And it was only afterwards that I realized how appropriate it was because it was in New York that I found out I was pregnant and where David came after the World Cup.” Awww, we love a cute story like that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmqaegYrC2uNOuqZ5nYWp6pLHLnpmsZaedvG66wKacnWWknbKqvoykoJ2rXZaztbHRZpqirJmawG7DxJ1kp52mmr9uw8CnpZplo6myoriO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
