Any and all claims to the contrary are ridiculous, and we look forward to proving so in a court of law.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The lawsuit was <a href=#>filed in August</a> by three former dancers, Arianna Davis, Crystal Williams, and Noelle Rodriguez,&nbsp;who name the singer, née Melissa Viviane Jefferson, dance captain Shirlene Quigley, and Lizzo’s production company,&nbsp;Big Grrrl&nbsp;Big Touring, Inc. as defendants.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/GettyImages-1681912585.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The “Good As Hell” singer is accused of pressuring the plaintiffs into touching a naked dancer in an Amsterdam nightclub and criticizing one of the dancers for their weight. Shortly after the disturbing allegations, the flutist <a href=#>refuted all claims.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Lizzo’s answer merely consists of boilerplate objections that have nothing to do with the case,” detailed Neama Rahmani, president of West Coast Trial Lawyers and&nbsp;attorney for&nbsp;Davis, Williams, and Rodriguez, in response to Lizzo’s request for dismissal.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“That said, the key takeaway is that Lizzo is agreeing to our clients’ demand for a jury trial. We look forward to presenting our case in court and letting a panel of her peers decide who is telling the truth, Lizzo and her team who continue to shame the victims or the plaintiffs and so many others who have come forward sharing very similar stories of abuse and harassment.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6G2u8bOZqmeqaWawLW%2FjJ2grKWZqMBuv8SxrJqkXZ2us63SrKSepqRiuaLD0q6grWVhZ4B1g5hvamlwXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
