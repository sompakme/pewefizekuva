In April 2013, she was spotted wearing a huge diamond ring—but she played coy about whether she was engaged when asked in interviews.</p><p>Tellingly, Milian took to Instagram on June 12 with a message about starting fresh and living the life you want. She <a href=#>shared</a> a photo of a quote reading: "There comes a time in life, when you walk away from all the drama and people who create it. Surround yourself with people who make you laugh, forget the bad, and focus on the good. Love the people who treat you right. Pray for the ones who don't. Life is too short to be anything but happy. Falling down is part of life, getting back up is living."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Alongside the pic, she wrote, "Morning inspiration. Turn your life around and do all the things that make you happy. It's your life to live."</p><p>What makes Milian happy besides her daughter Violet,&nbsp;is her career. The multi-talented star is continuing to work on her music and acting career, and is also busy with other ventures including Viva Diva Wines, Platinum E Hookah, and a new docu-series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoKKewLW1zZpkpqGcnq6vecWimKeblWK3or%2BMqamippOaerS8y6KrZquZo7SmvoyepZ2rXZq7qK3GnqSepqRif3F9k2tnb2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
