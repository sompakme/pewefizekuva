Michelle</b> visited <a href=#>HuffPost Live</a> on Thursday, March 3, and she opened up about her past experience with abuse and explained how this made her stronger.</p><p>“[I was told] by the higher-ups to be quiet, so I was never quiet,” Michelle shared. “If I have this pedestal that they’re trying to place me up on, I’m going to use it, whether to support a <b>Kesha</b> or just an everyday woman.”</p><p>“Support is what is needed to make the changes within the industry and within other aspects of society right now,” the Memphis, Tennessee native said.</p><p>Michelle is not afraid to voice her support for strong women. Last month, the chart-topping artist spoke at a <b>Hillary Clinton</b> campaign rally in South Carolina. “I pick certain things that are important to me. I believe you can’t take every issue in the world, but you pick what’s important to you, a couple things, and you drive them home,” the musician, 32, said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“I like the fact that’s she’s big on funding for historically black universities,” the “Anybody Wanna Buy a Heart?” singer explained, recalling her financial struggles at Florida A&M University. “That caught my attention and I said, ‘You know what? This is who I want to support!’”</p><p>Although she is a known Clinton advocate, she has no problem with any other candidate except one: <b>Donald Trump</b>. “I just think that’s a reality TV show president … We’re in this microwave world right now … it’s kind of like a popularity contest,” the award-winning musician claimed. “Some people think that Trump is amazing … amazing, but if he wins, I just got to move!”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You’re running for president and someone’s getting bullied. Hands are being put on a woman at that, and you’re not going to do anything about it,” the mother exclaimed, addressing the recent incident where a young black girl was pushed and shoved at a Trump rally. “No, I’ll pass.”</p><p><b>Have a question you’d like to ask a celebrity?
