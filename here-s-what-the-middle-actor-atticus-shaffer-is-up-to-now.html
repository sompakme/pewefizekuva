Every once in a while, a show like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Friends</a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Office</a> can come along and change the game, but those are few and far between. Many successful sitcoms can run on television for years, much like The Middle did when it was airing new episodes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Atticus Shaffer was a lead on the series, and he was a perfect fit for the role of Brick. Shaffer has been spotted in tons of other projects over time, and he has put together quite the filmography over the years.</p><p>Let’s take a look and see what actor Atticus Shaffer has been up to since The Middle!</p><h2 id=he-just-appeared-on-39-never-have-i-ever-39>He Just Appeared On 'Never Have I Ever'</h2><p>Because The Middle is what Atticus is best known for, it makes sense that he would continue to thrive on the small screen. Earlier this year, he appeared in one episode of Never Have I Ever, which is a Netflix series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series itself was released earlier this year, and people seemed to enjoy what it brought to the table. Atticus only appeared in one episode, but thanks to his success from The Middle, people recognized him immediately. On the show, he played the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Russia Model UN representative</a>, which was quite different from his Middle character, Brick.</p><p>The series has been picked up for another season, so maybe we will get the chance to see Atticus on the show once again.</p><p>Outside of Never Have I Ever, Atticus also concluded his time on the series Harvey Girls Forever earlier in 2020. The series ran for 4 seasons and had a total of 52 episodes, and Atticus’ character, Melvin, was a mainstay on the animated series.</p><p>2020 was quite a year for the actor, and when looking back at his past successes, it should come as no surprise that he can pull down steady work.</p><p>Not only has he continued to make waves on the small screen, but he has also turned his attention to radio and has found a home on a long-running series there, as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Zach Braff Has Been Up To Since ‘Scrubs’</a></span></p><h2 id=he-voices-morrie-on-39-adventures-of-odyssey-39>He Voices Morrie On 'Adventures Of Odyssey'</h2><p>Atticus Shaffer has done plenty of voice work over the years, and back in 2016 he would begin his time on a radio series that has been airing episodes since the 1980s.</p><p>For the unfamiliar, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adventures in Odyssey</a> is a Christian radio drama that has been a fixture on the radio for decades now. Outside of its target audience, there may not be a lot of people familiar with this program, but given its incredible success, it does seem fitting that Atticus would jump at the chance to be involved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since 2016, the actor has been portraying the character Morrie on the radio drama. He has been open about his religious beliefs, and given that this is a Christian show, it’s probably one that he grew up listening to. This type of voice acting is valuable experience that he is gaining, and it’s work that he can be incredibly proud of.</p><p>Interestingly, we have heard Atticus’ voice in major projects before. According to IMDb, he has lent his voice to Frankenweenie, Super Buddies, and Subject: I Love You. Clearly, he has a knack for delivering solid performances as a voice actor.</p><p>Turns out, his voice acting talent caught the attention of Disney, who would use him for a successful project that wrapped up recently.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amber Rose Recently Had Her Second Child, But What Else Is She Up To These Days?</a></span></p><h2 id=he-just-wrapped-up-39-the-lion-guard-39-for-disney>He Just Wrapped Up 'The Lion Guard' For Disney</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Getting the chance to voice a character for Disney is like hitting the jackpot, as it can lead to something that earns money for years. For Atticus Shaffer, he would spend his time as the character Ono on The Lion Guard.</p><p>According to IMDb, Atticus was on the series from 2016 to 2019 as Ono, meaning that he was balancing The Lion Guard and The Middle at the same time. This is not an easy thing to do, but he was able to thrive on both shows.</p><p>Not only did he play Ono on the series itself, but he would also participate in the movies, as well. In total, IMDb shows that Atticus appeared in three Lion Guard movies. The most recent film came out last year, meaning that he just finished up his time as the lovable character.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything Tom Welling Has Been Up To Since ‘Smallville’</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though The Middle has been over for some time now, Atticus Shaffer has remained exceptionally busy. Outside of acting, Shaffer is also active on YouTube, where he posts videos regularly. It’s another way that he gives that fans what they want while having some fun doing so.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Has Sam Worthington Been Up To Since ‘Avatar’?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZK2glWK6qrDDpZxmmZOpvLN5wK2ropulqHq0tMCfnZ6qXZ7AbsHPZquoZZ6kxHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
