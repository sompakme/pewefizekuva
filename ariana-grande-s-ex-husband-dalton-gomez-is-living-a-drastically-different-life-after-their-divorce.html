Able to <a href=#>spend her immense riches</a>, Grande is the kind of star who gets special treatment so often that <a href=#>it is remarkable when she is treated like everyone else</a>.</p><p>In Gomez's case, he had to figure out how his life was different. The reason for that is getting married to and divorced from Grande has changed his life in a lot of ways.

Listed on the website for the Aaron Kirman Group, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gomez's profile states that he has seven years of experience in the business</a> as of this writing.</p><p>Since high-end real estate agents have the potential to become very wealthy, it seems extremely likely that Gomez is financially secure. As a result, there is every reason to believe that Gomez can still afford an affluent life following his divorce from Grande.</p><p>Considering it is extremely unlikely that Gomez's lifestyle has taken a huge hit, that begs an obvious question. What makes Gomez's life so different now that he is divorced from Grande. The simple truth is this, Gomez's life will never be the same again as long as his ex-wife remains a popular star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/ariana-grande-denied-cheating-on-mac-miller-but-has-she-ever-admitted-to-being-the-other-woman_.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Ariana Grande Denied Cheating On Mac Miller But Has She Ever Admitted To Being The Other Woman?</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Ariana Grande has been subjected to unfair cheating rumors surrounding Mac Miller, but the rest of her relationships have also courted scandal.</span><p>In July 2023, Hollywood Life published an article about Gomez making his way back into the dating pool after his marriage failed.
