Police records revealed Hilarie went on a date with Hailey&nbsp;Rose &nbsp;Bustos, 18, the night before at a bowling alley. After inviting her on a second date, Bustos reportedly conspired with&nbsp;Andre Warner, 26, &nbsp;Gary Terrell Gray, 31 and Joshua Ellington, 26 on their plans. Auburndale Police Deputy Chief Andy Ray says the group more than likely wanted to rob Hilarie of the items in his home like his TVs, Xbox game console and his iPhone and didn’t intend to kill. &nbsp;Hilarie was shot in the head after pleading for his life and telling the group about his 5-year-old daughter.</p><p>“I think the plan was that he get robbed and that they take his stuff.” Deputy Chief Ray said during a news conference. “Her comfort with the way this went, didn’t seem like it was her first time. If she hasn’t done it before, then she has talked to people who have done it.” Each suspect was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery, robbery with a firearm/deadly weapon and first-degree murder. Ray told advise those who date online to be cautious of who they allow into their home.</p><p>“There’s so many places that you can check people out now on the computer,” he said. “It’s probably a good idea to [do] that first. You need to get to know them better so you can judge their character and also judge their intentions. Sometimes you can figure that out. But, also, as a first date, it’s not a good idea to take somebody to your home.”</p><p><a href=# rel=nofollow>https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FKeraMashek%2Fvideos%2F1176116692452524%2F&show_text=0&width=400</a></p><p>A <a href=# rel=nofollow>GoFundMe</a> has been set up for Hilarie’s funeral expenses. So far, close to $5,800 of the $10,0oo goal has been raised. A memorial was also held by loved ones and residents who also lived on Sunset Avenue. His brother Angel Cruz explained his grief and sympathy towards his niece.&nbsp;“She doesn’t even quite understand yet,” he said. “I would never want anyone to be in the shoes I am in right now, or my family, or any of our close friends, anyone. I don’t want no one to feel the way we’re feeling right now.”</p><p>Plenty Of Fish hasn’t commented on the incident.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5uuta3LZqmompKav7p50p6rZq2gYsGpvs6unqFln6O5qrrEZpuarJmjtG6%2FyK2cZqSVlsOmv4yfo6iqmZmubrnAp2SdnZGZenWAlm1obWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
