Alongside the unforgettable stories, the Star Wars films have also become synonymous with <a href=#>blockbuster success</a>, drawing in audiences from around the world and generating billions of dollars at the box office. This article explores the top ten highest-grossing Star Wars films, ranked based on their inflation-adjusted earnings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=star-wars-episode-ii---attack-of-the-clones-2002---1-076-billion>Star Wars: Episode II - Attack Of The Clones (2002) - $1.076 Billion</h2><p>Despite its two-decade existence, the performance of Attack of the Clones still appears lackluster when compared to its counterparts. Upon its release in 2002, the film barely surpassed the $650 million mark, falling short by a staggering $400 million in comparison to its predecessor. Such a substantial decline is difficult to justify, particularly considering the film's association with one of the largest and most esteemed franchises in history. Had it been released in the present day, it would likely have generated a revenue surpassing one billion dollars, yet it would still remain the lowest-earning entry within the main <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skywalker Saga</a> by a significant margin.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-2019---1-244-billion>Star Wars: The Rise Of Skywalker (2019) - $1.244 Billion</h2><p>When considering The Rise of Skywalker's initial box office earnings and the adjusted gross profit accounting for inflation, there is minimal disparity, given that it is the most recent addition to the franchise and is merely three years old. However, irrespective of how fans analyze it, the film remains an overall letdown and a rather unremarkable release that Disney would prefer to erase from memory. Since its release, it appears that the only notable use of the film has been as a source of memes, with the quote "Somehow, Palpatine Returned" destined to become a classic for all the wrong reasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=rogue-one-a-star-wars-story-2016---1-303-billion>Rogue One: A Star Wars Story (2016) - $1.303 Billion</h2><p>When the Star Wars spin-off film <a href=#>Rogue One</a> surpassed the box office earnings of one of the main Skywalker saga movies, it left Disney questioning whether they had stumbled upon a winning formula or made a significant misstep. Rogue One introduces compelling new characters and delivers the closest experience to an authentic star war. Nevertheless, it would be intriguing to ponder the impact on box office earnings if the movie had not featured the chilling and captivating hallway scene, as it undeniably left a lasting impression on viewers.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>All Of Jennifer Aniston's Boyfriends, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=star-wars-episode-iii---revenge-of-the-sith-2005---1-317-billion>Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge Of The Sith (2005) - $1.317 Billion</h2><p>Revenge of the Sith fell short of matching The Phantom Menace's box office triumph, as the diminishing returns of the prequel trilogy indicated a decline in interest among general audiences. Nevertheless, it outshone Attack of the Clones by a considerable margin in terms of success. While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Attack of the Clones</a> caused some concern among fans regarding the trilogy's final installment, the outcome proved to be immensely rewarding, exceeding expectations. Despite earning hundreds of millions less than a couple of Disney's Star Wars movies, when adjusted for inflation, it emerges as a significantly more accomplished achievement.</p><h2 id=star-wars-return-of-the-jedi-1983---1-413-billion>Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi (1983) - $1.413 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Apart from the prequel trilogy, which benefited from delivering a long-awaited culmination, a slight pattern emerges in Star Wars movies. The final installments of the trilogies tend to be the least successful. Just as <a href=#>The Rise of Skywalker</a> underperformed, Return of the Jedi also recorded the lowest box office earnings among the original trilogy. The reasons behind the comparatively lower success of both films share certain similarities. Nevertheless, when compared to other non-Star Wars movies, Return of the Jedi's earnings stands as a phenomenal accomplishment.</p><h2 id=star-wars-the-last-jedi-2017---1-616-billion>Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) - $1.616 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Star Wars: The Last Jedi marked the initiation of the concluding phase for the current iteration of the franchise. The initial fervor surrounding the return of Star Wars had gradually subsided, and fans' enthusiasm for Disney's creative offerings waned following their initial viewing of The Last Jedi. While <a href=#>The Force Awakens</a> achieved great success thanks to fans repeatedly watching it in theaters, those very fans exhibited less urgency to see the 2017 film. In addition, the film's astounding adjusted gross of $1.6 billion is truly remarkable.</p><h2 id=star-wars-episode-i---the-phantom-menace-1999---1-826-billion>Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace (1999) - $1.826 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While surpassing a billion dollars in box office earnings has become a common feat in today's cinematic landscape, it was a rarity during the 1990s. Despite the mixed reception it receives today, the film garnered glowing reviews from critics upon its release, which significantly contributed to its resounding success. The anticipation surrounding the first Star Wars film in 16 years was so overwhelming that it seemed to cloud people's judgment at the time. Moreover, the incredible marketing campaign had already established Darth Maul as an <a href=#>iconic figure</a>, adding to the film's allure.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Highest-Grossing Spiderman Movies, Ranked</a></span></p><h2 id=star-wars-the-empire-strikes-back-1980---1-935-billion>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) - $1.935 Billion</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Following the monumental success of A New Hope, it was expected that The Empire Strikes Back would achieve similar heights. In retrospect, it is astonishing to comprehend the substantial revenue generated by a sequel as dark and impactful as this. The Empire Strikes Back is widely regarded as one of <a href=#>the greatest sequels ever made</a>. Furthermore, it is an extraordinary achievement that a movie released in 1980 managed to amass an adjusted gross of almost $2 billion, despite having a title that hints at the story's outcome.</p><h2 id=star-wars-the-force-awakens-2015---2-586-billion>Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) - $2.586 Billion</h2><p>It is truly remarkable that The Force Awakens surpassed The Empire Strikes Back in inflation-adjusted earnings. This achievement can be attributed largely to the fact that similar to The Phantom Menace, fans had eagerly awaited new Star Wars content for a considerable period. However, the film's success can also be attributed to a combination of exceptional marketing, skillful fan service, and a fresh approach that resonated with audiences.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=star-wars-a-new-hope-1977---3-790-billion>Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) - $3.790 Billion</h2><p>A New Hope achieved a <a href=#>remarkable theatrical revenue</a> of $775 million in 1977. However, the true magnitude of its success becomes evident when accounting for inflation. Adjusted for today's inflation rates, the film's box office gross translates to an astonishing additional $3 billion in value. This impressive figure surpasses the combined profits of numerous other franchises, underscoring the immense financial impact of A New Hope.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT: <a href=#>The Richest Nickelodeon Stars Ever, Ranked</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Numbers</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDB</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbGMamdmoJmctaa%2F02aeq6ejqLavs4ysq5qqXayus7%2BMn6ClpaNiv6K6yp6baA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
