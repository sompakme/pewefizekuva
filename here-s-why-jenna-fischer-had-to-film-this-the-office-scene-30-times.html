So, which scene did Jenna Fischer have to do over and over again? Let's jump in!</p><h2 id=jenna-filmed-her-firing-scene-30-times>Jenna Filmed Her Firing Scene 30 Times!</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jenna Fischer brilliantly portrayed the role of Pam Beesly in the hit series, The Office. Pam's storyline revolved around her romance with Jim Halpert, all while being the receptionist and assistant to Scranton manager, Michael Scott.</p><p>During the very first season, a series of cutbacks are required throughout the Dunder Mifflin company, and Michael Scott, unfortunately, had to let go of Pam. Well, during the tense moment, Michael lets Pam know she's been let go for stealing post-it notes, despite that not being true at all, however, when Pam begins to cry, Scott reveals he's just joking when in reality, he isn't.</p><p>Luckily for Pam, she got to keep her job, however, for Jenna Fischer, that one scene made her job very difficult! During her podcast with Angela Kinsey, The Office Ladies, Fischer revealed that the firing scene was filmed not once, not twice, but <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">THIRTY times!</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Responsible For One Of Jenna Fischer's Worst 'The Office' Moment</a></span></p><p>According to Fischer herself, the scene took a whopping 30 times before she got the perfect take. Additionally, this was also the scene in which she auditioned for the role of Pam, and while she crushed it the first time, she found herself having a bit more of a hard time when it came to actually film the scene.</p><p>Jenna went on to say that it was the scene she had to re-do the most times on The Office, and considering the emotional range required for it, from being confused, sad, to angry, Fischer finally nailed it, delivering us with an Office moment that fans will never forget.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Angela Kinsey chimed in, claiming Jenna's performance was "brilliant", and funny enough, she was actually meant to play her! Kinsey said that she had initially <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">auditioned for the role of Pam Beesly</a>, however, following Jenna's stellar performance in all 9 seasons, it's clear she was truly made for the part.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Jenna Fischer Really Thought Of John Krasinski When They First Met</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tNhmoZ6mnpZ6p7XSnJ%2Beql2drqV506hkn6Gconq1tMisZK2glWK8p7LInJxmq5Oau6Z5kmlkraGdmsBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
