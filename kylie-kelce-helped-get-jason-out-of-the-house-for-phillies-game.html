We talked about it before … [but] after losing to the Jets, I was like, ‘Man, do I really want to be seen at this place?'” he explained. “I wanna make sure that we’re focused … but I was like, ‘Screw it.'”</p><p>Jason was “so happy” he got to see the Phillies on the road to another World Series. Travis, 34, credited Kylie with getting Jason “out of the house with ol’ Travy.”</p><p>“Thankfully, [she] was there and was kinda like, ‘Yeah, that’d be pretty sweet if we went,'” Travis recalled. “I could tell she was, like, the final [say]. Like, ‘Maybe if Kylie wants to go, I’ll go.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kylie-Kelce-Helped-Get-Jason-Out-of-the-House-for-Phillies-Playoffs-After-Eagles-Loss.jpg><p>Travis and Jason Kelce attend Game One of the Championship Series between the Arizona Diamondbacks and the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park on October 16, 2023 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.Cameras caught Travis and Jason in the stands on Monday night — and the announcers couldn’t help but <a href=#>bring up Travis’ romance</a> with <a href=#><strong>Taylor Swift</strong></a>. “Looks like a seat’s available in between [them],” one MLB broadcaster teased as the Kelces were shown chatting with beers in hand. “I don’t know, all you Swifties, looks like it might be a bros night tonight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Kylie-Kelce-Helped-Get-Jason-Out-of-the-House-for-Phillies-Playoffs-After-Eagles-Loss-Inline.jpg><p>While she didn’t make an appearance at the MLB game, Swift, 33, has become a staple at Travis’ Kansas City Chiefs games since the pair began dating last month. She first <a href=#>surprised fans at Arrowhead Stadium</a> on September 24, cheering for the Chiefs from a VIP suite. Swift later <a href=#>brought her A-list squad of friends</a> to a game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey before returning to the Chiefs’ home stadium on Thursday, October 12.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As she works her way into the folds of the Chiefs fandom, Swift has also connected with Travis’ parents, <a href=#><strong>Ed</strong> and <strong>Donna Kelce</strong></a>. After their father was <a href=#>spotted chatting with Swift</a> at Thursday’s game, Travis and Jason joked about the “terrifying” turns the conversation could have taken.</p><p>“He’s probably saying, ‘I’ve taken all your CDs out at the local library and I’ve burned them into my computer because that is legal as a tax-paying citizen,” Jason teased on “New Heights,” while Travis added, “I feel terrible for Taylor.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyesm63xKWanmWYmrmxscNmnp6sXZ%2ButLvNZqaurF2ks27Ax55koaelqLJuss6rZKmgmaG5qrHSZp6apZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
