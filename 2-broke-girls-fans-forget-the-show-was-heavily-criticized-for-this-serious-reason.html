Sadly, the reality of the situation is that throughout its time on television, 2 Broke Girls had its fair share of detractors. In fact, there have been some people who have extremely serious issues with 2 Broke Girls for extremely valid reasons.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>13 Tiny Details From Behind The Scenes Of 2 Broke Girls</a></span></p><h2 id=critic-call-out-racism-on-2-broke-girls>Critic Call Out Racism On 2 Broke Girls</h2><p>Even though 2 Broke Girls was an award-winning show with a loyal following, the truth of the matter is the sitcom never was a critical darling by any means. Still, most of the reviewers who took 2 Broke Girls to task didn’t go much deeper than tackling the series’ style of comedy and storylines. Still, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one reviewer was extremely frank about her biggest problem with 2 Broke Girls</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2011, a New Yorker reviewer named Emily Nussbaum wrote about 2 Broke Girls at great length. As a part of her article, Nussbaum made it clear that she felt the show had loads of potential for several reasons. “A deep female friendship, raw humor about class, and a show that puts young women’s sexuality dead center, rather than using it as visual spice, as in some cable series about bad-boy antiheroes.” On the other hand, Nussbaum wrote about the racial stereotypes exhibited on 2 Broke Girls with great eloquence.</p><p>“There’s plenty to dislike about ‘2 Broke Girls,’ especially the ensemble, which is conceived in terms so racist it is less offensive than baffling. The girls’ Korean boss, Han (Bryce) Lee, talks funny, is short and sexless, and wants to be hip; the black cashier is played by Garrett Morris, who should sue for the limp gags he’s fed; and the horny Eastern European cook has punch lines such as ‘Once you go Ukraine, you will scream with s* x-pain.’”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>'Kim’s Convenience’: Fans React To Cast Revelations On ‘Overtly Racist’ Storylines</a></span></p><h2 id=here-39-s-the-reaction-from-the-co-creators-to-the-controversy>Here's The Reaction From The Co-Creators To The Controversy</h2><p>Even though Emily Nussbaum’s 2 Broke Girls review was published the same year the series debuted, the show never changed enough to evade accusations of racism. In fact, it could be argued that the show’s stereotyping issues only got worse as the year after that review came out, 2 Broke Girls added a new character to its main cast, Jennifer Coolidge’s Sophie Kaczynsky. Even though a lot of people love Coolidge and her 2 Broke Girls character, having an American actor play an over-the-top Polish stereotype like that didn’t help things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As a result of the fact that the show was consistently accused of racism, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">things blew up at a 2012 event that was designed to promote 2 Broke Girls</a> which co-creator Michael Patrick King and the show’s stars Kat Dennings and Beth Behrs attended. As a writer for Uproxx named Alan Sepinwall wrote, before the event started, he asked CBS entertainment president Nina Tassler about 2 Broke Girl’s stereotypes. In response, Tassler stated that it takes time to add “dimensionality” to a sitcom’s supporting characters. From there, Tassler defended 2 Broke Girls as “an equal opportunity offender”.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>2 Broke Girls: 20 Photos Of Max And Caroline We Can't Stop Looking At</a></span></p><p>Later in his article about the aforementioned event, Alan Sepinwall quoted 2 Broke Girls co-creator Michael Patrick King’s response to being confronted about the show’s stereotypes. “If you talk about stereotypes, every character, when it’s born, is a stereotype: A blonde and a brunette, which has certain stigmas as well, which we’ve tried to defuse and grow.” From there, King went on to ask the reporters in attendance to judge the show’s arguably stereotypical characters “in five years” because by then, he would have the time to make them more nuanced.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At that point in the aforementioned event, 2 Broke Girls co-creator Michael Patrick King defended the show in a much more full-throated way. “I personally am thrilled with everything we’re doing.” That comment wasn’t enough to put an end to the conversation and eventually, King explained his perspective on the situation based on his own sexuality. “I’m gay! I’m putting in gay stereotypes every week! I don’t find it offensive, any of this. I find it comic to take everybody down, which is what we are doing.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ultimately, throughout the press event, 2 Broke Girls co-creator Michael Patrick King continued to be pressed on the show’s portrayal of race. Based on Uproxx writer Alan Sepinwall’s description of his responses, King got extremely defensive and he praised the show at great length. For example, King stated, “every conversation we’ve had about edge of ‘2 Broke Girls’ is based on extreme wit”. King also said things like “This show is so much fun for the audience I’m surprised the questions are not about fun”.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Was '2 Broke Girls' Canceled For Being 'Too Mean'?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhpZpqipLimecaiqaWrXZi%2FqsDInGSrmZOewK550p6voqudYsSpxYyiq2avkah6pK3NnJylnZRk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
