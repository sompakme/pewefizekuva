Probably too well done to a point where most people wouldn't want to eat it. I like my eggs almost burnt."</p><p>"Salt on it, pepper on it, 'Everything But The Bagel' seasoning on it," she listed off her personalized egg essentials, "Then I put some Cholula on that. Then I cut up a whole avocado, put that on top...That's my breakfast every day."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kylie Jenner's Favorite Foods (According To Social Media)</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Chamberlain talked about her work-filled lifestyle and how completing as many professional tasks as possible is a priority. She fits in a workout when she can, but ensuring emails get answered is at the top of her list.</p><h2 id=lunch-in-los-angeles>Lunch In Los Angeles</h2><p>"Lunch is the neglected meal. I don't think about it much," she admitted, "It's always Postmate'd. I never cook lunch. I could not tell you one time that I've cooked a lunch. Recently I've been ordering this salad from this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">restaurant called Zinc</a>. It's kale, lentils, carrots, (a) hard-boiled egg, and this nice salty, shallot-y vinegarette on top."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Chamberlain's 10 Best Instagram Outfits</a></span></p><p>A vegetarian burrito from LA's Tocaya Organica also often makes the cut as her choice of lunch.

They're called Mary's Gone Crackers...I eat those with spicy hummus...Another snack I make is mini, little cauliflower pizzas. I just put a little marinara sauce on it, a little pesto, a little bit of vegan mozzarella."</p><p>Nut butter and plums are also some of Chamberlain's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">current favorite foods</a>.
