Sometimes they undergo surgery to improve their aesthetic appeal by having a lip or breast augmentation or nose surgery, and this also includes treatments for their hair. A well-kept mane brings beauty and femininity to any woman. Hair is at the top of their list of physical grooming duties before appearing in public. Many celebrities have inspired very important hair trends. I mean, come on, who doesn’t remember Jennifer Aniston sporting ‘the Rachel’, or Farrah Fawcett with her ‘Farrah flicks’, Audrey Hepburn and her ‘Beehive’&nbsp;or Meg Ryan with ‘the shag’?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>From short to long, '50s glamour to bobs and boyish cuts, celebrities can usually pull them off. Today, however, we are going to look at some celebrities&nbsp;who had complete hairstyle fails and they should never have attempted the change. Kaley Cuoco, who plays Penny on The Big Bang Theory,&nbsp;had a very dramatic hairstyle change that fortunately did not last long - thank goodness for hair extensions. In an interview regarding her short hair, she stated, “it grows back, it’s not a big deal”, but apparently it was for her because she didn’t wait for it to grow back but instead, got extensions. Let’s look at some follicly challenged celebrities who had really bad hair days.</p><h2 id=kaley-cuoco---oh-no-penny-penny-penny>Kaley Cuoco - Oh No, Penny! Penny! Penny!</h2><p>Any fan of The Big Bang Theory is familiar with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaley Cuoco’s</a> hair chop that caught us all off guard for the beginning of season eight. The beautiful, long blond hair she sported since she burst onto TBBT scene in&nbsp;2007 has remained pretty much unchanged until the season eight shocker. Her trademark golden locks were chopped into a bob cut at first and then into an even shorter pixie later in the season.</p><p><strong>Kaley explained that the reason for the cut was because she was filming a movie and not because of her new life as a wife.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She offered to wear extensions for TBBT but producers were okay with it and wrote it in. Kaley made a smart move though, and quickly donned some hair extensions to help get her Penny look back.</p><h2 id=jennifer-aniston---and-that-my-friend-is-what-they-call-closure>Jennifer Aniston - And That, My Friend, Is What They Call Closure</h2><p>Now, who would ever believe <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jennifer Aniston</a>, known for setting hair trends like “the Rachel”, could ever be on a bad hair list? Well, we hold Jennifer to a higher standard and that means even if she is wearing a bob cut, it better look spectacular on her. Well as you can see, this is not a great look for our long-locked beauty but there was a reason for it. Aniston needed to chop her hair short because she admitted:</p><p><strong>“I did this thing called a Brazilian and my hair did not react really well to it”.</strong></p><p>This Brazilian blow dry is a very controversial treatment because it uses a combination of keratin and formaldehyde to keep your hair straight for as long as three months.</p><h2 id=miley-cyrus---where-is-hannah-montana>Miley Cyrus - Where Is Hannah Montana?</h2><p>Oh, what a shock and disappointment it was to her Hannah Montana fans when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miley Cyrus</a> revealed that her beautiful, flowing healthy brown hair was</p><p><strong>"not real. None of it was ever real. None of it was ever growing out of my head."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It caught all her tweenage fans off guard when Miley chopped off all her hair, dyed it blonde and spiked it up into a bold and edgy punk style. She explained how it was a spur of the moment decision to Harper’s Bazaar in an interview. “I was in Philadelphia working. I met Chris McMillian in my hotel room. I had him cut it, bleach it. And I got on the train that night and someone recognized me right away. I was like 'what d'ya mean!' I don't even look like myself to me now.” Sadly, this is the look we have all come to know and hate.</p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson---this-must-be-lucy-s-10-look>Scarlett Johansson - This Must Be <i>Lucy’s</i> 10% Look</h2><p>So, when you are considered one of the most beautiful and sexiest women in the world who has everything she possibly wants, what do you do? Well, you go out and get a really bad haircut. In 2003 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Scarlett Johansson</a> said,</p><p><strong>“I had a serious Florence Henderson haircut for a while. There was a total party going on in the back of my head! I had a 'mullet pride' shirt that I wore."</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>All we can say is thank goodness she grew up and out of her Brady Bunch locks. She has been known for her hair color switch ups and she can certainly pull them off with her flawless fair skin. Today Scar-Jo rocks a voluminous pixie cut which looks simply stunning on her.</p><h2 id=lindsay-lohan---better-hairstyles-in-her-mugshots>Lindsay Lohan - Better Hairstyles In Her Mugshots</h2><p>One of my favorite redheads of all time is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindsay Lohan</a>. Her glam factor is off the charts when she is donning her red hair. She has proven to the world how stunning redheads can be. However, anytime Lindsay goes blond, bad things happen to her. She got in a car crash, got too skinny, got two DUIs, got a possession charge, went to rehab several times and was sentenced to 90 days in jail for violating her parole, all while sporting the platinum locks. In four of her six mugshots, Lindsay is blond and not looking so great. She has tried to keep herself on the straight and narrow, but maybe for her, it’s as simple as buying a box of hair color.</p><h2 id=katherine-heigl---get-out-of-the-80s-please>Katherine Heigl - Get Out Of the '80s, Please!</h2><p>For most of us, there are bad hair days, but for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katherine Heigl</a>, this was an epic-fail-bad-hair period. Sporting her Dynasty-era bouffant, the actress reverted back to the '80s where nothing good happened but the music. Outdated and aging her at least a decade, I can’t imagine what she was thinking when she decided to do this.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>The dark, short and curly style does not work for her and nobody was really impressed with it.</strong></p><p>You have to give her kudos for trying to keep it interesting and mixing it up, but oh no, not that way. She can pull off a multitude of hair colors and look fantastic in all of them, but her style here is not a good one.</p><h2 id=katie-holmes---katie-scarlett-o-hara-you-are-not>Katie Holmes - Katie Scarlett O'Hara You Are Not.</h2><p>Mission Impossible? Finding <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Katie Holmes</a> having a bad hair day is certainly that, but on this day we got lucky and she had the worst of the worst. Katie who almost always is preened to perfection was strolling out and about in New York City’s Chelsea district when a sudden burst of wind got hold of her long locks and whipped them about on this blustery day. You could say Katie was Gone With The Wind. Her simple grey sweater paired with her jade pendant necklace and large designer sunglasses were not enough to hide her from the paparazzi who captured Katie looking at her worst.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga---thank-goodness-she-never-met-marilyn-manson>Lady Gaga - Thank Goodness She Never&nbsp;Met Marilyn Manson</h2><p>We all know <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lady Gaga</a> to be the quintessential person of a million looks but this particular one has really gone awry. Always taking her style to the next level and beyond,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>the singer posted on Instagram this ‘balding’ picture of herself.</strong></p><p>With a tightly pulled back ponytail, the photo really reveals her very receding hairline. This has quite possibly come from all the weaves and hair extensions she has donned throughout her music career. But this still does not explain what seems to be a shaved section of her hair at the back of her head. Please, Gaga, go back to making style trends but put this one to bed permanently.</p><h2 id=melanie-griffith---antonio-should-have-told-you-muy-mal-melanie>Melanie Griffith - Antonio Should Have Told You “Muy Mal Melanie”</h2><p>There are really no words to describe what <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Melanie Griffith</a> could possibly have been thinking when she got this particular hairdo, or should I say hair-don’t, which she is sporting here. Maybe it is just age catching up with her, but Melanie’s wrinkles are showing on her usually smooth face and this might be making her look even worse. She still has a figure any woman at any age would envy but sadly severe signs of aging have settled in and the hairstyle makes her look very awkward. Griffith has admitted to having facelifts and collagen injections but perhaps just a simple visit to the hair salon could remedy her ailments.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pink---seriously-pink>Pink - Seriously Pink???</h2><p>The evolution of Pink’s hairstyles over the years has been nothing short of amazing. Alecia Moore, AKA Pink, has been making her style a statement since she came onto the music scene in the 2000s. Her hairstyles have changed and morphed in conjunction with her musical career, but her message has always remained the same,</p><p><strong>“you don’t have to look one way to make your voice heard”.</strong></p><p>From her hot bright pink spikes in her early edgy days to her platinum blonde Mohawks, Pink has embraced them all. But at the 2000 MTV Music Awards, Pink took some dramatic fashion risks along with her hairstyle. Donning pink spikes, she really gave the establishment the middle finger, but it was not a very becoming look.</p><h2 id=kelly-osbourne---if-monday-had-a-face>Kelly Osbourne - If Monday Had A Face</h2><p>Daughter of Ozzy and Sharon Osbourne, 33-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelly Osbourne</a> is a British singer-songwriter, fashion designer, television presenter and actress. She and her family won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program in 2002 for The Osbournes. She is known for her style and panache and is no stranger to ever-changing hairstyles. From her two-toned (hot pink and black) asymmetrical blunt bobs to bleached blonde Mohawks, Osbourne has rocked them all. Regarding her pixie,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>she tweeted, "I know it's lavender, but having my hair this color makes me feel like me again!"</strong></p><p>The pastel hues look fantastic on her, but this jet black, sharp-banged do is not one of her best looks.</p><h2 id=christina-aguilera---are-you-sure-it-s-lady-marmalade>Christina Aguilera - Are You Sure It’s ‘<i>Lady’ </i>Marmalade?</h2><p>The Mickey Mouse Club’s Mouseketeer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christina Aguilera</a>, burst onto the scene in the '90s along with Britney Spears, Ryan Gosling and Justin Timberlake. Her career took off and continued to skyrocket throughout the years. It’s really hard to believe it’s been more than 17 years since the Lady Marmalade video with her, Lil' Kim, Mya and Pink came out. I think Christina was&nbsp;going for this burlesque look again in this photo, but sadly this time it was an epic fail. She's a long way from her Genie In A Bottle days. Come on now, Christina! What were you thinking? You really look like a drag queen with this hairstyle.</p><h2 id=emma-stone---not-so-pretty-in-pink>Emma Stone - Not So Pretty In Pink</h2><p>I know pink and lavender remind us of romance and femininity, but this lavender pink hairdo that actress <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Emma Stone</a> is sporting is not very complimentary for her violet pinkish pale complexion. According to her stylist who works on her hair often, Tracey Cunningham,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><strong>“For someone so young, Stone has a serious case of chromatic wanderlust. She’s a natural blonde, but she feels most like herself when she’s red.”</strong></p><p>Well, from her stints as a blonde, brunette and redhead, it’s clear Emma is not afraid to experiment with her hair color, but she should stick with her instincts of feeling good being red. Please don’t think pink again!</p><h2 id=britney-spears---my-hair-is-like-i-have-none>Britney Spears - “My Hair Is Like, I Have None”</h2><p>35-year-old singer <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Britney Spears</a> is a success story today, headlining in Las Vegas and making a whopping $30.5 million last year, but even 10 years later, her head-shaving moment is still seared into our memories. In 2007, pop culture history was made the day she walked into a California hair salon and shaved off all of her beautiful blonde locks. Sadly, not only was this new look not her best one, but she was on a slippery slope to rock bottom. In pop culture, we sometimes associate haircuts with fresh starts from a breakup, a makeover you could say, but her bald dome took on a whole new meaning. The pop starlet literally discarded her most feminine attribute and this was a very sad&nbsp;and bad time for her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=gwyneth-paltrow---no-worries-with-this-look>Gwyneth Paltrow - No Worries With This Look</h2><p>Once named by People magazine as the World’s Most Beautiful Woman, I think they might just rethink if she is worthy of that title after seeing this picture of her. Spotted in New York early in the morning, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Gwyneth</a> was barely recognizable with her wet, unkept hair and not&nbsp;a stitch of makeup on. She did speak up about her wet-hair, no makeup look to People Magazine. She said,</p><p><strong>“Around the house, I’m in jeans and a T-shirt. I don’t really wear makeup.”</strong></p><p>Her ex husband Chris Martin, Coldplay’s frontman, used to think it was pretty funny when she got all glammed up as Paltrow said, “he’ll be like, “Oh, wow! You're Gwyneth Paltrow!”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWakmZyaxm6v1KiaqKtdqLWwvtNmn5qhomKwtsCMmqWdZWFperDAx56pZpuVobKjv4ywn6hlkaeybrLOpaOim5yueqS0wKWjnqaXmrFw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
