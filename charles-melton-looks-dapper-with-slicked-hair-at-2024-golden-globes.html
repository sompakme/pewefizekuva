At the soirée, he looked extra handsome in a navy blue Armani tuxedo featuring a double-breasted jacket with black lapels, a dark bow tie and matching pants. He completed his ensemble with patent leather shoes, diamond stud earrings and a watch from Omega.</p><p>Melton’s hair was parted down the side and swept over his forehead, reminiscent of the popular slicked-back ‘do from the 1920s.</p><p>To achieve his retro look, celebrity beauty guru <strong>Candice Birns</strong> used STMNT Grooming products to slick back his hair as well as CeraVe skincare.</p><p>“I cleansed the skin then did a Lymphatic massage,” she said in a statement shared with Us Weekly. “Next, I moisturized with <a href=# rel=noopener>CeraVe Ultra-Light Moisturizing Gel</a> & used the <a href=# rel=noopener>CeraVe Skin Renewing Eye Cream</a>.” She continued, “Love the lightness of the product that makes it a great base when using a tinted face oil on top. There’s no flaking of the skin so you can layer other products with it effortlessly.”</p><p>Birns topped Melton’s look off with <a href=# rel=noopener>Solawave’s 4-in-1 Radiant Renewal Skincare Wand</a> to de-puff the skin and create a flawless complexion.</p><p>As for his date, Charles brought along his mom, <strong>Sukyong Melton</strong>, who rocked a classic black dress, a sparkly necklace and dangling earrings. She parted her hair to the side and wore it blown out. The duo adorably held hands and smiled for the camera.</p><p>At the 2024 ceremony, Charles was <a href=#>nominated for</a> Best Supporting Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture for his role as Joe in May December, which premiered in November 2023.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Charles has walked a red carpet with his mom. Last month, Sukyong joined her son at the Critics Choice Celebration Honoring Black, Latino & AAPI Achievements where he was awarded with Best Breakthrough Performance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Charles-Melton-Looks-Nice-in-Navy-at-the-2024-Golden-Globes-%E2%80%94-While-Attending-With-His-Mom-837.jpg><p>For the evening, Charles went shirtless underneath a plunging navy blue coat and paired the garment with black pants and combat boots. Sukyong, meanwhile, looked radiant in a black midi dress finished with a pearl embellished collar.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While accepting his award, Charles gave thanks to his mom in an emotional speech. “I stand today in front of my mother. I’m proud of my Korean American heritage. Umma, umma,” he said while tearing up. “You are my hero.”</p><p>Charles previously took both of his parents — including dad <strong>Phil Melton</strong> — to the 2019 premiere of The Sun Is Also a Star. The men both suited up while his mom opted for a white blouse and gray coat.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5i1or7LnqpmpZWhwbC6jKWmqKOjYrGivM%2BeqWavmam1br%2FLopqknZRitaK10WaYrWViZX91ecaoo52dnmK0rbvBnqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
