The relationship between Keanu and Alexandra turned romantic in 2019 when the couple first appeared on the red carpet, and in late 2023, they could only gush about one another.</p><p>But when it comes to breaking down what their relationship is really like, fans might be a bit surprised to hear what Alexandra had to say.</p><h2 id=keanu-reeves-and-girlfriend-alexandra-grant-have-creativity-in-common>Keanu Reeves And Girlfriend Alexandra Grant Have Creativity In Common</h2><h3 id=keanu-and-alexandra-have-worked-together-on-various-creative-projects>Keanu and Alexandra have worked together on various creative projects</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/keanu-reeves-and-alexandra-grant-looking-extremely-happy.jpg><p>While the two were "just friends," <a href=#>Keanu and Alexandra worked on a book together</a>, which featured Alexandra's drawings and Keanu's poetry. Later, Grant published a photography book with Reeves as the sole subject. Clearly, <a href=#>Grant does not work a typical 9 to 5</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Grant noted that the 54 photographs were of her "longtime friend." The artist has plenty of other subjects, too, but of course, fans wondered <a href=#>whether her association with Reeves helped Grant's career</a>.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Alexandra-Grant.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Does Alexandra Grant, Keanu Reeves' Younger Girlfriend, Dye Her Hair Gray?">Does Alexandra Grant, Keanu Reeves' Younger Girlfriend, Dye Her Hair Gray?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>People have assumed Alexandra Grant is much older than Keanu Reeves because of her gray locks, but it turns out she chose the look.</p><p>Not that Keanu seemed to be concerned about it. In an interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandra also remarked that "falling in love as an adult" was great</a> because she already had her career established by the time she and Keanu connected.</p><p>Alexandra also commented that she felt very "confident" in the relationship and "very confident in the relationship on the red carpet." That wasn't all Alexandra had to say in an interview with People.</p><h2 id=alexandra-gushed-about-keanu-in-a-solo-interview>Alexandra Gushed About Keanu In A Solo Interview</h2><h3 id=people-interviewed-alexandra-grant-about-keanu-in-2023>People interviewed Alexandra Grant about Keanu in 2023</h3><p>While Keanu Reeves may be a man of few words when it comes to his personal life, his girlfriend had no issue gushing about her man in a September 2023 interview. It wasn't immediately clear what the interview was meant to be about, but the only quotes People had to share were related to Grant's relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What I love about Keanu and our exchange is that we're pushing each other to build new roads. Seeing the other person's problem-solving is inspiring, like, ‘Oh, well, okay, this one, that's a cul-de-sac. How do I try this other thing?’</p><p>Grant also compared her work to Reeves', noting that hers is more of a private performance of text to canvas, whereas Keanu's is text to performance. Grant praised Keanu's work, not only on the big screen but on stage, too.</p><p>As a longtime fan of Dogstar, Alexandra was thrilled to support Keanu at his band's shows.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/keanu-and-alexandra-cute.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="15 Little Known Facts About Keanu Reeves And Alexandra Grant's Relationship">15 Little Known Facts About Keanu Reeves And Alexandra Grant's Relationship</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>As Reeves has been labelled a lone wolf for many years, people seem to be pretty excited to see the Matrix actor smiling next to a woman again.</p><h2 id=grant-39-s-work-has-become-quot-happier-quot-since-falling-in-love>Grant's Work Has Become "Happier" Since Falling In Love</h2><h3 id=inspired-by-keanu-alexandra-noted-her-work-seems-happier-now>Inspired by Keanu, Alexandra noted her work seems happier now</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/instar45529480.jpg><p>In 2021, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandra sat down for an interview with The Artist Profile Archive</a>, where she talked about her art and the creative process while her art was shown via film.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the time, Grant was discussing her piece Antigone 3000, which features an interpretation of a quote from Antigone about living to love rather than hate. While the subject was heavy, the pieces themselves weren't, which might be indicative of how Grant's work has changed since 2019.</p><p>Grant noted that people had told her her art was happier after she began dating Keanu, something she was happy to hear, although it wasn't surprising.</p><p>I had a studio visit a few years ago, and this very kind, very high-level person said, 'I can see that your work has gotten happier.' That's real. We're all human beings. We're animals. We're expressing from where we are and certainly feeling happier. I think the work is happier.</p><p>During one 2022 interview with W Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexandra only mentioned Keanu in passing</a>, noting that the two lived together in Berlin while he was working on The Matrix and John Wick 4, but she spoke a lot about gratitude and seemed joyful with her current work and life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not every interview has to be about Keanu, of course, especially as Alexandra is an artist who's recognized in her own industry in the same way Keanu is in his. But their lives are clearly intertwined, something that has fans thrilled for the both of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinpmeqnqzscSvnKxll56%2FrbLRopynnF2WuabEwKebq5ldnL%2BiutNmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCpZZSawaK1y6xm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
