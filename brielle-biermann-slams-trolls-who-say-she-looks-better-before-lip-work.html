I love it! It’s a breath of fresh air to see someone stand up for their actions/looks and actually believe it!”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/brielle-biermann-before-her-lip-injections.jpg><p>The message concluded: “Thanks for encouraging me to do my thing and be myself without saying sorry. Even if you didn’t know you were.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time the Bravo TV personality has shut down gossip about her appearance. Biermann has taken to social media on multiple occasions to deny plastic surgery rumors and clarify she has only gotten her lips done.</p><p>Last month, Biermann’s mom, <a href=#><strong>Kim Zolciak</strong></a>, was <a href=#>slammed for a photo</a> she posted on Christmas morning that showed her eldest child’s lips swollen. “Holy s—t….what’s wrong with her lips,” one follower wrote on the pic of Biermann, prompting Zolciak, 40, to turn off the comments on the post.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Real Housewives of Atlanta start previously opened up to Us Weekly about the <a href=#>constant scrutiny she and her family receive on social media.</a></p><p>“Messing with my kids is gonna be a big one, you know? … Let’s use Brielle’s lips, right? So when Brielle wanted her lips done. It was something that she’s never really liked,” Zolciak told Us in July 2018. “She’s always talked about wanting bigger lips. She turned 18, I took her to the best. That’s her decision, her choice. I took her to the best. She was very open because she said she didn’t want other girls that felt like her to not know that there wasn’t an option. So she shared that with the world. Then, they’re like, ‘You look like a duck, you look awful, they look terrible, blah, blah, blah,’ and Brielle’s like, ‘Well f—k, maybe I shouldn’t say anything.’ I said, ‘No, you just basically do you.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabqpmaua2xjJugnqqdlruvedKlmKarXam%2FsLjLrGSwoJ9iwKLFjKyfnmWcpLysscNmmZ6spJq%2Fbq7En6arnV2htrF51qippGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
