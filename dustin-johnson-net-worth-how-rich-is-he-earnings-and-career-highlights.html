Earnings And Career Highlights</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-05</div><p><strong>Dustin Johnson’s net worth</strong> is believed to be $50 million. He is one of the top golfers and swing masters. Dustin Johnson is a PGA Tour professional golfer from the United States. With his achievement at the St. Jude Classic in 2017, Johnson already had the number one place in the Official World Golf Rankings.</p><p>Johnson is also one of the highest-paid golfers in recent history. He also has 23 PGA Tour victories and six Gold Championship championships in his career. Johnson’s power can overpower golf courses, but he squandered some huge chances early in his career and had a reputation as a bit of a rogue. However, after starting a family, Dustin won several big championships and rose to the top of the rankings. If not much, we have included enough information on the pro golfer in this article, including career highlights, wife, children, and many other fascinating facts.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dustin-johnsons-net-worth></span>Dustin Johnson’s Net worth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dustin Johnson’s net worth is $50 million as of 2023. The bulk of his net worth stems from his golf career and a lengthy history of tournament victories.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-earnings></span>Career Earnings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Johnson has amassed a sizable fortune as a result of his championship and success on the course. So far, the American golfer has won more than $70 million in tournament awards.&nbsp;After winning the FedEx Cup in 2020, he received $15 million. This places him third all-time in golf earnings, after Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson. However, if FedEx is excluded, Johnson’s position as the highest earner falls to sixth.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dustin-johnson-childhood-and-education></span>Dustin Johnson: Childhood and Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dustin Johnson was born on June 22, 1994, in Columbia, South Carolina. Scott Johnson and Kandee Johnson are his parents. Dustin’s father, Scott, was a well-known club pro, so he began going to the range with him at the age of six. Justin Johnson has one brother, Austin Johnson, and one sister, Laurie Johnson.&nbsp;Dustin’s grandpa, Art Whisnant, was a three-time All-Atlantic Coast Conference pick at South Carolina in the early 1960s. Dustin’s brother Austin has served as his caddy (someone who carries a golfer’s club and offers other help during a match) since 2013.</p><p>Dustin acknowledges that Austin is his closest buddy, and the two brothers have had tremendous success on the course. Austin caddied for Dustin for the first time in 2013 at the Perth International in Australia. Austin then played point guard at Charleston Southern University before being summoned to carry his brother’s clubs.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=education></span>Education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Johnson attended South Carolina’s Dutch Fork High School. Dustin later went on to play college golf at Coastal Carolina University.&nbsp;His lifelong love of golf inspired him to pursue a variety of goals. He studied Sports Management at university. He had outstanding accomplishments as an amateur golfer throughout his undergraduate days.&nbsp;As a consequence, he became the only player after Tiger Woods to win a championship in his first seven seasons out of college.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dustin-johnsons-professional-career></span>Dustin Johnson’s Professional Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dustin traveled to his first PGA Tour in 2008 after playing several games in college. It marked the beginning of his professional career. He won the Turning Stone Resort Championship in New York on the inaugural PGA Tour.&nbsp;Within two years, Johnson had risen to the 15th position on the PGA Tour’s money list. After beating former world champion David Duval (two-time PGA Tour winner Holmes), he rose to number four in 2010.&nbsp;Dustin competed in the 2011 Open Championship and finished in second place.</p><p>As a consequence of his outstanding performance, he has risen to seventh place in the Official World Golf Ranking.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Dustin had an injury at the start of the 2012 season and missed the US Open cut after falling one point shy of the cut mark. Johnson won the US Open in 2016, his first of three PGA Tour titles.&nbsp;In the same year, he topped the circuit in earnings, and average, and was named Player of the Year.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=a-new-era></span>A New Era<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dustin had a successful year in 2017. He won the Genesis Cup and the WGC-Mexico Championship, propelling him to the top of the global rankings.&nbsp;Johnson earned his third title in 2018 when he won the RBC Canadian Open. He also represented the United States in the Ryder Cup.&nbsp;Dustin won the Master’s Tournament in 2020, earning his first green jacket.&nbsp;Despite having 11 Master’s appearances under his belt, Dustin’s 2020 performance was remarkable and broke several records.&nbsp;In February 2021, Johnson will win the Saudi International for the second time. He was also chosen to represent the United States in the Ryder Cup 2021.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=dustin-johnsons-wife-and-kids></span>Dustin Johnson’s Wife and Kids<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Dustin is engaged to Paulina Gretzky, a model, actor, singer, and social media sensation. She is also the daughter of hockey star Wayne Gretzky.&nbsp;Paulina has featured in Adam Sandler films such as Grown Ups 2 and Guns, Girls, and Gambling.&nbsp;Wayne, Paulina’s father, is from Canada, while Paulina was born in Los Angeles, California. Dustin and Paulina began dating in 2013 and married seven months later.</p><p>The pair has not yet married, but they have two boys, Tatum Gretzky, and River Jones. Tatum Gretzky Johnson was born on January 19, 2015, and River Jones was born on June 12, 2016.&nbsp;There was some news about the couple’s breakup in 2018. The suspicions began when Paulina erased all of Dustin’s photographs from her Instagram account.&nbsp;However, once Dustin issued a statement stating his commitment to becoming a family man, both men reconciled.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJylqMGquoyjpqGmo6S7brrErWSwp6KptW60zrBkq6GTnXqqv4yhnGadkae7qrrGrGSappRisKK%2BxJ6pZqCZnLWttcahq6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
