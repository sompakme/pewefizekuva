It was the main event of the night and was for the Undisputed WWE Universal Championship.</p><p>After a brutal battle, The Head of the Table <a href=#>managed to defeat</a> Zayn thanks to some help from his Bloodline faction.</p><p>As 2023 has come to an end, fans and critics alike are sharing their list of the best wrestling matches in the year. One fan named Zayn vs Reigns as his favorite match with Ilja Dragunov and Dijak’s bout as his second favorite. <a href=#>Dijak</a> replied to the fan agreeing with his picks and gave heaps of praise to both Sami Zayn and Roman Reigns.</p><p>“As much as I love seeing my own work praised, and trust me I do, Roman Reigns vs Sami Zayn was one of the best matches I’ve ever seen and I think people just forget because they wanted a different winner.
