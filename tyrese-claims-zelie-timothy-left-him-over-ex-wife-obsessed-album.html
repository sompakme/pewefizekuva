She can use whatever platform she want. She can write a book, do a podcast.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I wish her well,” he added. “But if you can express your thoughts and feelings and play victim, then I can express my thoughts and my feelings through my music, through me writing books, me doing interviews.
