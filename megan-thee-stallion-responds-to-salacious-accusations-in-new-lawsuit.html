He also alleges he was told not to repeat what he saw to anyone and was allegedly subject to verbal harassment following the incident.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Megan Thee Stallion, born Megan Pete, has denied the <a href=#>“salacious” allegations.</a></p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This is an employment claim for money — with no sexual harassment claim filed and with salacious accusations to attempt to embarrass her,” the rapper’s lawyer, Alex Spiro, told <a href=# rel=nofollow>Page Six </a>Tuesday. “We will deal with this in court.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1402413264.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">According to Garcia, him and the “Body” rapper were on a 2022 tour stop in Ibiza, Spain when she returned to their vehicle with three women and began having sex with one of them while right beside him. “Plaintiff could not get out of the car as it was both moving and he was in the middle of nowhere in a foreign country. Plaintiff was embarrassed, mortified and offended throughout the whole ordeal,”&nbsp;reads the complaint.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I felt uncomfortable. I was kind of frozen, and I was shocked. At kind of, just the overall audacity to do this right, right beside me,” Garcia told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow" href=#>NBC News</a>&nbsp;in an interview.&nbsp;He added that, the following day, he was told by the artist, “don’t ever discuss what you saw.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He further claims that, after the incident, Megan began to<a href=#> fat-shame </a>him with statements like,&nbsp;“spit your food out” and “you don’t need to be eating” while calling him a “fat bi**h.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“To hear someone who advocates about loving your body tell me these things,” Garcia said in the interview, “I felt degraded.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“Megan just needs to pay our client what he’s due, own up to her behavior and quit this sort of sexual harassment and fat shaming conduct,” Ron Zambrano, an attorney for Garcia, said in a statement to&nbsp;NBC News.&nbsp;“Emilio should never have been put in a position of having to be in the vehicle with her while she had sex with another woman. ‘Inappropriate’ is putting it lightly. Exposing this behavior to employees is definitely illegal.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Garcia is seeking over six-figures in the suit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX6KyqK3NZquhnZViwLWty6WgqKZdp7K0vM6nm6xlnprEbrjAsKquoaRifnN%2Fk3Fua29gZXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
