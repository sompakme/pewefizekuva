Viewers can also tune in to the coronation — which ABC will re-air throughout the day — via <a href=#>ABCNews.com</a> and <a href=#>GoodMorningAmerica.com</a>.</p><p>BBC America is also likely to cover the historic moment for American viewers with a TV subscription, as BBC will be airing the day’s events in the U.K.</p><p>The celebrations will continue on Sunday, May 7, with Charles’ <a href=#>official coronation concert</a>, which will be broadcast across <a href=#>all BBC networks</a>, ABC/GMA and other major news networks. The concert — which will feature performances from <a href=#><strong>Katy Perry,</strong></a> <a href=#><strong>Lionel Richie</strong></a>, Take That and more — begins at 8 p.m. U.K. time, meaning coverage will likely start at 3 p.m. ET.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a> are among many royal family members who will be in attendance at the coronation, including Charles’ siblings <a href=#><strong>Princess Anne</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Prince Andrew</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Prince Edward</strong></a>, along with their <a href=#>respective children</a>. Camilla’s <a href=#>son Thomas and daughter Laura</a> — whom she shares with ex-husband <strong>Andrew Parker Bowles</strong> — are also expected to attend.</p><p>William, 40, and Kate’s three kids — <a href=#>Prince George</a>, 9, <a href=#>Princess Charlotte</a>, 7, and <a href=#>Prince Louis</a>, 4 — will all be <a href=#>participating in the ceremony</a> by walking in the coronation procession with the rest of their family.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a> confirmed he would be <a href=#>attending his father’s coronation</a> without his wife, <a href=#><strong>Meghan Markle</strong></a>, on April 12. The following day, a source exclusively revealed to <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that the former Suits star decided to skip the event because it lands on the same day as her and Harry’s son <a href=#>Archie</a>’s fourth birthday. The couple also share their 22-month-old daughter, <a href=#>Lilibet</a>.</p><p>“As much as Meghan appreciates the invite to the coronation, she wouldn’t miss her son’s birthday for the world,” the insider said at the time. “Despite being the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan <a href=#>is a mom first</a>.”</p><p>A second source told <a href=#>Us</a> on April 14 that the new monarch was “sad” about his daughter-in-law’s decision not to attend the coronation, noting, “Charles was hoping the coronation would be a chance to <a href=#>better connect and maintain healing</a> between them.”</p><p>Meghan’s absence <a href=#>isn’t the only controversy</a> surrounding the historic day. Camilla’s coronation crown, <a href=#>Queen Mary’s 1911 Coronation headpiece</a>, features the Koh-i-Noor diamond, which was seized by the East India Company in 1849. <a href=#>The Palace</a> announced in February that the crown would be modified to replace the Koh-i-Noor diamond.</p><p>In addition to several musicians — including <a href=#><strong>Elton John</strong></a>, the <a href=#>Spice Girls</a>, <a href=#><strong>Adele</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Harry Styles</strong></a> and more — <a href=#>declining initiations</a> to perform at the coronation concert, the <a href=#>Daily Mail</a> reported in February that Prince Andrew, 63, will not have a ceremonial role in the coronation. The Duke of York, was <a href=#>stripped of his royal titles</a> in January 2022 amid a <a href=#>sexual assault lawsuit</a> and news of <a href=#>his connections</a> to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Another source informed <a href=#>Us</a> on April 13 that Prince Andrew’s ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Sarah Feguson</strong></a> — with whom he shares daughters <a href=#><strong>Princess Beatrice</strong></a>, 34, and <a href=#><strong>Princess Eugenie</strong></a>, 33 — “did not” receive an invitation to the coronation. However, <a href=#>Us</a> confirmed on April 19 that the Duchess of York, 63, would be attending the coronation concert.</p><p>Meanwhile, the cost of the coronation has sparked backlash, as a report by the <a href=#>Centre for Economics and Business Research</a> speculated that the event will cost the country millions of dollars.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoZ6ceqS0wKujnqtdmLyzu82aq6KnnmJ%2FcX6SZq6hmaRiwaq5xGauoZ2imnq1u4ywmK2bmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
