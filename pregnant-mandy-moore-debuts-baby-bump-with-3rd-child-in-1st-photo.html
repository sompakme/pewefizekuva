“Last night’s lewk,” Moore, 40, wrote via Instagram Story on Saturday, June 1. “Guess I don’t have to try to camouflage anymore.”
Moore uploaded a mirror selfie of herself cradling her baby bump. She wore a long, sleeveless leopard-print dress with coordinating black sandals. The actress styled her tresses in a wavy bob and, for glam, added a pink lip."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The third in our own Big Three coming soon,” she wrote via Instagram on Friday, May 31, referring to the <i>This Is Us </i>catchphrase. “Can’t wait for these boys to have a baby sister <span class=s1>💓💓</span>.”</p><p class=p1>Moore starred as matriarch Rebecca Pearson on<a href=#> the six-season NBC series</a>, who was the mother to “triplets” Kevin (<strong>Justin Hartley</strong>), Kate (<strong>Chrissy Metz)</strong> and Randall (<strong>Sterling K. Brown</strong>). Rebecca’s first husband, Jack Pearson (<strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong>), coined the “Big Three” term to refer to their three children as a unit.</p><p class=p1>Moore, Brown, 48, and costar <strong>Chris Sullivan</strong> recently started a recap podcast called “That Was Us” and Moore informed both Brown and Sullivan, 43, of her pregnancy while posing for promotional photos.</p><p class=p1>“In the middle of our photo shoot, Mandy Moore tells me she’s got a new arrival,” Brown wrote via his Instagram Story on Friday. “Couldn’t have made another face if I tried! Congrats, Momma!!”</p><p class=p1>Moore and Goldsmith, 38, have been together since 2015. They tied the knot in 2018, three years before welcoming son Gus. Baby No. 2, son Ozzie, followed one year later.</p><p class=p1>“I’ve always wanted to be a mom. Before bringing my two boys into the world with my love, @taylordawesgoldsmith, I was a mom to many, many cats and at times, just as many dogs (and admittedly today, I still am),” Moore <a href=#>wrote via Instagram</a> in January. “But there was a time when I thought I might not be able to have kids. I remember when the doctor told me there was a slim chance of getting pregnant.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Moore previously dealt with fertility and intrauterine issues.</p><p class=p1>“We did ovulation tests, all that stuff. I was fully prepared to go have surgery and fix my uterus and hopefully get rid of the endometriosis if it was there,” she recalled to <i>Romper</i> in January 2021. It was nice to have a plan and to know, ‘OK, well, this is why I haven’t been pregnant yet.’”</p><p class=p1>Moore learned that she was pregnant with Gus before needing to schedule a uterine surgery.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGapqpWcu6K602akmqaUrnquu86rnGaclZfCtb%2BMm5ibsV2Xwq68jLCgraBdaL%2BlecKhoKWcXZ67bn3SrWSpoJ%2BpvHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
