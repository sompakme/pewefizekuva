Khloé Kardashian attempted to set the record straight as fans noticed something odd about a photo taken of her in a Paris hotel room.
After a picture of the 38-year-old Kardashians star in a slimming black bodysuit made the rounds on social media, some users began to question the photo’s origin. “No bc someone send me a screenshot of it ACTUALLY on her feed/the actual post bc… i’m confused,” one fan tweeted on Tuesday, October 4."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Maybe my glam did but I didn’t. Also I mean… The bent lines in the back lol please 🤣.”</p><p>However, Kardashian’s defense didn’t exactly dispel the drama. When fans called her out for <a href=#>seemingly blaming the Photoshop fail</a> on her team, she cleared the air once again. “Wait not sayin my glam did that either in just saying I didn’t post this photo on my page. Where’s the receipts that I did lol people are so weird,” the Strong Looks Better Naked author wrote on Tuesday.</p><p>In the glamorous snap, taken during <a href=#>Paris Fashion Week</a>, Kardashian posed in a black Balenciaga ensemble with one leg propped on a chair and her arms draped over the edge of a fireplace. The Good American cofounder’s waist <a href=#>appeared to be disproportionately small</a>, and some fans believed her curves were manipulated.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Khloe-Kardashian-Denies-Posting-Poorly-Photoshopped-Photo-After-Being-Called-Out-by-Fans.jpg><p>While the pic in question has since been deleted, <a href=#>Kardashian has been sharing updates</a> from her adventures in France during the fashion extravaganza. “It’s giving Kris Jenner energy,” she captioned a carousel of Instagram photos as she lounged in a white bathrobe with a glass of champagne in hand.</p><p>The <a href=#>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a> alum has been outspoken online when it comes to editing photos over the years. In April 2021, <a href=#>she issued a lengthy statement about body image</a> after an unflattering bathing suit photo was wiped from the internet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“You never quite get used to being judged and pulled apart and told how unattractive one is, but I will say if you hear anything enough then you will start to believe it,” she wrote via Instagram at the time. “This is how I have been conditioned to feel, that I am not beautiful enough just being me. … My body, my image and how I choose to look and what I want to share is my choice. It’s not for anyone to decide or judge what is acceptable anymore.”</p><p>Her transformation recently became a topic of conversation after <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> brought up <a href=#>concerns about her sister’s weight</a> during an episode of The Kardashians. “You look very skinny. I will say that Kendall and Kylie — not that I’m trying to out them — but they did text me and say that they were a little concerned for you because you’re really skinny,” the 41-year-old told Khloé in the Thursday, September 29, episode. “I said, ‘I think she’s a bit stressed.'”</p><p>Khloé appeared to be honored by the comment as Kim continued, “I said, ‘You absolutely have every right to be concerned, but I’m telling you, she’s fine.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakoJyksm63wKubmquYnq6vecOepaKdo2K9sL%2FToqWgZaCdvLW70qGmqaiVmXqxtM6tpmaeoqS6brzAq6CsZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
