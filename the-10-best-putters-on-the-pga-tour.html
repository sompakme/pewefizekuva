How many strokes would you save per round?</p><p>Of all the ridiculous things PGA Tour professionals do with the golf ball, for all <a title="Bubba Watson Net Worth" href=#>Bubba Watson</a>’s 350 yard drives with 30 yards of right-to-left movement, for every 170-yard nine-iron shot, the pros putting from close range is just as incomprehensible.</p><p>So, how do we determine who the best of the best are? Simple, take a look at the leaders in the strokes gained-putting statistic from the past five seasons and see how many strokes these putting maestros picked up on field averages during that period of time.</p><p>What’s strokes gained-putting, you ask? Here’s an explanation and example from the PGA Tour:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The statistic is computed by calculating the average number of putts a PGA TOUR player is expected to take from every distance, based on ShotLink® data from the previous season. The actual number of putts taken by a player is subtracted from this average value to determine strokes gained or lost. For example, the average number of putts used to hole out from 7 feet 10 inches is 1.5. If a player one-putts from this distance, he gains 0.5 strokes. If he two-putts, he loses 0.5 strokes. If he three-putts, he loses 1.5 strokes.</p><p>Let’s have a look at the 10 best putters on the PGA Tour over the last five seasons.</p><h2 id=10-james-driscoll----5-year-stokes-gained-tally-1-595><strong>10.
