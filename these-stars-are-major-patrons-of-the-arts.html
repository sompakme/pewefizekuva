Many could not function without the financial backing of wealthy patrons, many of which are celebrities like actors, musicians, and world leaders. Whether it's through donations to organizations, auctions, elevating budding artists, or just putting together impressive collections, these big names are also some of the biggest supporters of the arts.</p><h2 id=martha-stewart><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Martha Stewart</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Exploring the Arts</a> is a non-profit organization, created by singer Tony Bennett and others, "whose mission is to strengthen the role of the arts in American education by returning arts-enriched programming to public schools across the country," according to LookToTheStars.com. Stewart also posted a feature on her website highlighting the most successful women in the modern art world, was spotted purchasing sculptures<a href=#> at the 2012 FiFi Awards</a>, and <a href=#>joined the NFT marketplace</a> in 2021. Many other stars have gotten into the NFT game, including <a href=#>Paris Hilton</a> and Martha Stewart's friend Snoop Dogg.</p><h2 id=lady-gaga><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Lady Gaga</span></h2><p>The list of celebrities who support Exploring The Arts is extensive. Among the many A-list names who have either endorsed the organization, donated to it, or both, one is pop diva icon Lady Gaga. So profound is her support of the arts, that SAG-AFTRA honored Lady Gaga at their 2018 Patrons Of The Artists Awards, <a href=#>along with Harrison Ford and Spike Lee</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=mikhail-gorbachev><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mikhail Gorbachev</span></h2><p>One cannot ignore a world leader using his clout and notoriety to support the thriving of the arts. Among the leaders to offer support to the arts via Exploring The Arts, and other foundations is ex-Soviet/Russian President Mikhail Gorbachev. Also, while he was still president of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev <a href=#>oversaw programs </a>that restored art from early Russian history for public viewing.</p><h2 id=leonardo-dicaprio><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Leonardo DiCaprio</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>DiCaprio collects all sorts of art, <a href=#>including prehistoric pieces</a>. DiCaprio is not only very well-connected to the art world, but he has also used said connections to raise money for the variety of philanthropic causes he supports. In 2018, DiCaprio hosted an art auction whose proceeds went to support the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, which fights for environmental protections and Indigenous people's rights. The auction featured an extensive array of rare pieces from iconic artists, including <a href=#>a Wayne Thiebaud painting worth $3 million</a>.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jeff Bezos' GF Lauren Sanchez Thirsts For Leonardo DiCaprio At LACMA Art Gala</a></span></p><h2 id=jay-z-and-beyonc-eacute><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Jay-Z and Beyoncé</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The notorious power couple i<a href=#>s both a prominent pair of art collectors and supporters of budding artists</a>. Beyoncé hired the previously unknown photographer Awol Erizku to take her pregnancy announcement photos, and hired Tyler Mitchell for a Vogue shoot, making him the first Black photographer to shoot a cover for the magazine. Jay-Z is also well-versed in the arts, listing names like Rembrandt, Jeff Koons, and Basquiat as just some of his favorites. He has also said he's drawn inspiration from the likes of Koons and Hearst for his music and performances. The two also like to bring daughter Blue Ivy along with them to art auctions, <a href=#>where she has at times helped them to land the winning bid</a>. One can also dig up pictures of Jay-Z and Beyonce dressing up like famous artists, like the time Jay-Z dressed up as Basquiat and Beyoncé as Frida Kahlo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Share Their Art On Twitter As Meek Mill Says He Wants To Invest</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ellen-degeneres><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Ellen DeGeneres</span></h2><p>According to ArtNet.com and Architectural Digest, DeGeneres' home<a href=#> is full of rare and exotic pieces</a> by some of the world's most famous artists. DeGeneres is the proud owner of some of Diego Giacometti’s bronze cat statues, paintings by pop art legend Andy Warhol, and sculptures by Ruth Osawa. She and her partner Portia De Rossi are involved with several art ventures, <a href=#>and in 2020 they auctioned off</a> an impressive chunk of their collection.</p><h2 id=steve-martin><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Steve Martin</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The comedian and actor is both a prominent patron and collector and he is lucky enough to own some of the rarest pieces of art in the world, including Picassos, O'Keefes, and more. He has been interviewed about his love of art by CBS, done educational videos for The Museum Of Modern Art on how to observe and appreciate abstract art, and of course, he has donated to art programs. He also used his celebrity status to draw attention to an underappreciated school of art called "synchronism," and he helped launch an art fund <a href=#>that supports the elevation of Indigenous artists in Australia</a>.</p><h2 id=johnny-depp><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Johnny Depp</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the defamation lawsuit between Johnny Depp and Amber Heard was tumultuous and at times heartbreaking, the public didn't just learn the worst about either star. One positive takeaway from the trial was how far Depp will go to support creatives he admires, like his friend artist Issac Baruch. During his testimony, Baruch revealed that Depp supported his rise to prominence by giving him a place to live and supplying the funds for his first art exhibition. Baruch went from being a struggling artist <a href=#>to being a millionaire</a> almost overnight thanks to Johnny's support.</p><h2 id=cheech-marin><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Cheech Marin</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor and stoner comedian of Cheech and Chong fame is also a prominent supporter of Chicano arts. Marin, who is Chicano, has an extensive collection of Chicano art and has bankrolled several exhibitions that revolve around Chicano culture and history. His patronage is so deep and profound that there is now a museum dedicated to Chicano art and academics named for Spy Kids and Desperado actor. The Cheech Marin Center For Chicano Art And Culture, also known as "The Cheech" opened in 2022 in Riverside California and holds over 500 pieces of art.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnq0wMCrqmaZopp6rq3JqKlmqJGpv7C60mamn2WknbJurdGtqmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
