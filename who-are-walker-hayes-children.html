Since his success, the singer-songwriter and his family have enjoyed a $16 million net worth, but they have also endured heartbreak. In 2018, Hayes and his wife, Laney Beville Hayes, lost their newborn child Oakleigh Klover Hayes when Laney suffered a ruptured uterus during childbirth. This is a very rare occurrence during childbirth, but it is a highly deadly one, and it not only killed Oakleigh Hayes, but it also put the life of Laney at risk as well. Hayes’s wife has since made a full physical recovery, but not an emotional one.<span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Dolly Parton Dedicates Academy Of Country Music Awards To Ukraine">Dolly Parton Dedicates Academy Of Country Music Awards To Ukraine</a></span>Hayes has spoken and sang about the tragedy openly, and has since fallen back on the support of his already large family. <a href=#>Hayes currently has six surviving children</a>, but the loss of Oakleigh hit them all very hard. These are the surviving Hayes children, three boys and three girls: Lela, Chapel, Baylor, Beckett, Loxley, and Everly. Although she died in childbirth, Hayes and his wife make a point to honor the memory of their late child and keep their surviving children as close as possible. Hayes has written several songs paying loving tributes to his children. Hayes, never wanting to forget Oakleigh, got a tattoo of her footprint and her name.<strong>Updated on November 30, 2022: </strong>This year, Walker Hayes released a new album entitled Country Stuff the Album. To celebrate, he booked a cross-country tour and, for the first time, brought the entirety of his family... <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">including their two dogs</a>! He and Lela made the decision to pack up their stuff (temporarily) and bring the kids and pets with them while Walker toured America. This way, the family could spend more time together and make memories in several states.<strong></strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lela-hayes-is-their-oldest-child-and-first-daughter><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Lela Hayes Is Their Oldest Child And First Daughter</span></h2><p>Lela Hayes is the oldest of Walker and Laney’s six children. She was born in December 2006. While she (understandably) does not have a public social media of her own, she does make frequent appearances on <a href=#>her father’s TikTok with songs “Fancy Like.”</a> She even occasionally takes over posting duties. In a way, Hayes’ eldest is his social media manager. The internet had some words for the Hayes family in 2020 when <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">they threw a “period party” for their daughter</a> to honor her crossing the threshold into womanhood. They also served a red velvet cake on the occasion. Yes, really.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why Is TikTok Canceling John Lennon?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chapel-hayes-is-their-first-born-son><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Chapel Hayes Is Their First Born Son</span></h2><p>Chapel Hayes, their firstborn son, came into their lives in 2008. Little is known about the child since the Hayes family does a good job keeping their children out of the public eye (save for Lela’s control over her dad's TikTok), but Walker Hayes does have a 2019 song titled “Chapel,” telling the story of his son's birth. The song came a year after the loss of baby Oakleigh and is featured on his 2017 album 8Track.</p><h2 id=baylor-hayes-is-the-singer-of-the-family><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Baylor Hayes Is The Singer Of The Family</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Two years after Chapel Hayes came his first brother, Baylor Hayes. Baylor Hayes might be the one to end up following in his father’s footsteps because in 2017 Walker Hayes posted a video on his Facebook account featuring his son, then around 6 or 7 years old, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">singing classic Don Williams songs.</a> The comments on the video complimented the boy's singing voice and with his father’s connections, he may have a future in the country music industry.</p><h2 id=beckett-hayes-is-the-one-with-a-hit-song-named-after-him><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Beckett Hayes Is The One With A Hit Song Named After Him</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Walker Hayes clearly loves his children to no end, as he frequently writes songs named after them. In his hit “Beckett,” which also came out in 2017, Walker Hayes tells the story of his boy, then four years old, and about his love of breakfast cereal, sports, and how he admires his son for being unbothered by people who are different from himself. Some lyrics from the track include; “Don't know if he's rich or poor, Says it's cool that the girl next door, has skin like chocolate. When I grow up, when I grow up, I wanna be like Beckett.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="Fans Are Split When It Comes To Meeting This Country Music Star">Fans Are Split When It Comes To Meeting This Country Music Star</a></span></p><h2 id=loxley-hayes-is-the-second-daughter><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Loxley Hayes Is The Second Daughter</span></h2><p>The fifth of their six surviving children, Loxely Hayes was born in 2014. Considering she isn't even in the double digits yet, little can be said about her life or personality. However, like Lela, she does make the occasional appearance on Walker Hayes’ TikTok along with her other siblings. It will be interesting to see what the future holds for the second-youngest Hayes child.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=everly-hayes-is-the-baby-of-the-family><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Everly Hayes Is The Baby Of The Family</span></h2><p>The sixth and youngest of the Hayes children has only recently started school and as such a young child, she is rarely seen outside the company of her mother, as is normal for a child as little as she. Everly has been spotted in the occasional TikTok, thanks to Lela.</p><h2 id=oakleigh-hayes-may-she-rest-in-peace><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Oakleigh Hayes, May She Rest In Peace</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Oakleigh would have been a toddler now, had she survived. While she is no longer with us and her death was an inconsolable tragedy for the Hayes family, Walker and his wife make a point of honoring her with a tattoo on his arm and somber remembrances of their lost seventh child on her birthday. After a few months of mourning, Hayes eventually opened up public ally about the loss and how it affected him and his wife. Doctors did attempt to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">save the child by giving her mother a cesarean section</a>, but unfortunately, it was to no avail.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="How Close Did Danica Patrick Come To Becoming A Country Music Singer?">How Close Did Danica Patrick Come To Becoming A Country Music Singer?</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2Bmedaao6SdomK1osXErGSappRiuaK6xLJkm52mnrmtsYyhmLKdo2KwqbXLnamepl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
