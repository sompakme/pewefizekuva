This seems fitting in the sense that both shows revolve around the life of mature friends and the antics they get into.</p><p>However, this comparison of a 2022 show to one from 1985 shows just how far ahead of its time The Golden Girls actually was.</p><p>The creation of The Golden Girls was actually a long time coming that involved a lot of effort from its creator to convince others in television that the show had a lot of potential.</p><p>Today, we know that The Golden Girls s a classic that has entertained audiences for decades that just can’t get enough of its heart and comedy, but the making of the show has a rich history in and of itself.</p><h2 id=susan-harris-produced-39-the-golden-girls-39>Susan Harris Produced 'The Golden Girls'</h2><p>Susan Harris is an American writer and producer.</p><p>According to IMDb, she is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">best known for her work in the show Soap</a>, which she used as a launching point for her career that then allowed her to create The Golden Girls.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Harris was a unicorn at the time in the world of writing comedy for television. Most writers' rooms were filled with men, as most of the shows on TV featured mostly male casts.</p><p>Women were not expected to be funny, and even if they were, it wasn’t easy for them to find work as a writer.</p><p>Harris managed to overcome many barriers at the time and would go on to create, write, and executive produce many TV shows, including Maude, The Partridge Family, and Benson.</p><p>Billy Crystal once called her, “the first genius I had ever met.”</p><h2 id=susan-harris-signs-on-to-lsquo-the-golden-girls-rsquo>Susan Harris Signs On To ‘The Golden Girls’</h2><p>In 1985, NBC was looking for a writer to create a show about older women living in Miami. The pitch idea came from a sketch promoting a much different show than The Golden Girls;Miami Vice.</p><p>NBC brought the idea to its team of writers; however, a basically all-male writers' room was not excited to be handed the opportunity to write a show all about women, let alone ‘older women’.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily for the world, Paul Witt was in that writers’ room.</p><p>“I was sitting with another writer when [NBC executive] Warren Littlefield gave us this idea about older women, and this writer said, ‘I don’t write old people,’” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Witt recalls in an interview with the Emmy’s</a>. “I said, ‘I know someone who would be interested.’’’</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Old Is Betty White? 10 Things You Need To Know About The ‘Golden Girls’ Star</a></span></p><p>That someone was Susan Harris.</p><p>Harris had a unique quirk about her as a writer; she didn’t pitch ideas, she just wrote stories. This broke the rules for members of the writers’ room at the time, but Harris knew her strengths were as a storyteller, not as a pitch-creator.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This trait is what helped the stars align in the creation of The Golden Girls.</p><p>“When Paul told me ‘older women,’ I was thinking women in their 70s,” Harris said in the same article. “I love writing older people because they have stories to tell. Of course, when the network was saying older, they were thinking women in their 40s.”</p><p>Harris didn’t think women in their 40s were old enough and decided to push the envelope further.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Knew?

She made a show that was created by women, written about women, and featured an all-female ensemble cast.</p><p>She addressed women’s issues, shook up the television world, and surpassed all expectations. Without her and her determination, there would be no The Golden Girls, and there would surely be fewer female-lead TV shows in the world today.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Golden Girls Hot Sauce Will Spice Up Your Life</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dmbalecaoo52dnmK0qr7LrGSsrJGnwXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
