They first crossed paths at a charity event in Atlanta in 1990.

They hardly considered each other as romantic partners, and it wouldn't be that way until a former US president would play something of a matchmaker for them.</p><h2 id=everything-to-know-about-jane-fonda-39-s-friendship-with-former-president-jimmy-carter>Everything To Know About Jane Fonda's Friendship With Former President Jimmy Carter</h2><p>The friendship between former President Jimmy Carter and actress Jane Fonda is one that has been scrutinized and debated over the years. Their unlikely bond was formed in the late 1970s, during a time of political upheaval and social change in America.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>How did they come to know each other? What drew them together?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/th-image-template.jpg><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Hill</a>, the first time Jimmy Carter and Jane Fonda met was at a fundraiser for the presidential campaign in 1976. Despite their different backgrounds and political beliefs, they immediately hit it off. They shared a mutual passion for social justice and human rights, which quickly became evident during their initial interactions.</p><p>What made their meeting particularly interesting was the fact that they came from such different worlds. Carter was a Southern Baptist peanut farmer who had served as governor of Georgia, while Fonda was an actress and activist <a href=#>known for her anti-war activism during the Vietnam War</a>. However, despite these differences, they found common ground in their desire to promote peace and equality.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carter himself was no stranger to political activism. As governor of Georgia, he had campaigned for civil rights and opposed segregation per The New York Times. His presidential campaign in 1976 focused on restoring trust in government after the Watergate scandal and promoting human rights abroad. Carter's support for Fonda could be seen as part of his broader commitment to progressive values at that moment in time.</p><p>However, not everyone saw it that way. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to The Chicago Tribune</a>, some conservatives criticized Carter for associating with someone they deemed a traitor. They accused him of being soft on communism and undermining American interests abroad.</p><p>One of the most notable things about Carter's friendship with Fonda is how it challenged stereotypes about political polarization. Many people assume that those on opposite sides of the political spectrum can never find common ground or even be friends. However, Carter's friendship with Fonda shows that this is not always true - people can disagree on important issues but still respect each other as individuals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, meeting Jane Fonda was a turning point in Jimmy Carter's life. She helped him see beyond his own experiences and broaden his understanding of social justice issues around the world. Their initial interactions set the foundation for a lifelong friendship based on mutual respect and shared values. Despite criticism from some people, their friendship endured for many more years.</p><h2 id=did-jimmy-carter-really-get-jane-fonda-to-date-mogul-ted-turner>Did Jimmy Carter Really Get Jane Fonda To Date Mogul Ted Turner?</h2><p>According to The Hill, rumors about a romantic relationship between Jane Fonda and Ted Turner began to circulate in the early 1990s while Fonda was still married to media mogul Tom Hayden. These rumors were fueled by reports that former President Jimmy Carter had played a role in introducing Fonda to Turner. The alleged involvement of one of America's most respected political leaders in a celebrity romance sparked widespread interest and speculation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/this-former-us-president-played-matchmaker-between-a-young-jane-fonda-and-mogul-ted-turner.jpg><p>To fully understand the significance of this story, it is important to consider the historical context of the relationship rumors. At the time, Fonda was still a controversial political activist and Hollywood icon.</p><p>Turner was a media magnate known for his unorthodox business practices and his creation of CNN, which revolutionized cable news. Meanwhile, Carter had recently left office after a tumultuous presidency marked by economic challenges and foreign policy crises.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Jane-Fonda.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At this time, there was also a significant cultural shift happening in America. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The feminist movement gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s</a>, leading to increased visibility of women's rights issues. This coincided with a rise in celebrity culture, where famous people's personal lives were constantly scrutinized by tabloids and paparazzi.</p><p>These things would last even until today when some of the biggest A-list stars are women. Fonda was really one of the first female celebrity icons, paving the way for people such as Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Jane Fonda Said Jennifer Lopez 'Never Apologized' For 'Cutting' Her During A Slap Scene But J-Lo Has A Different Story</a></span></p><p>Against this backdrop, rumors began to circulate about Fonda and Turner's relationship. Some speculated that they were dating or even engaged, while others claimed that they were just friends or business partners. The exact nature of their connection remained unclear, but what is certain is that their public appearances together only fueled speculation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One event that particularly sparked rumors was when Fonda appeared on CNN's Larry King Live in 1991 wearing an engagement ring. While she did not explicitly confirm her engagement to Turner during the interview, many viewers believed that it was a subtle hint at their relationship status.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>These Were Larry King's Strangest Interviews</a></span></p><p>According to People, Turner and Fonda would publicly become partners a few months later and their wedding was confirmed. They would divorce in 2001, and things would never be the same between them. Fonda has been married one time since then, <a href=#>combining 3 marriages in total</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/jane-fonda-said-jennifer-lopez-never-apologized-for-cutting-her-during-a-slap-scene-but-j-lo-has-a-different-story.jpg><p>​​​​​​</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Carter would then interview with Wolf Blitzer in 2013 where he finally confirmed that he did indeed set Turner and Fonda up with each other.</p><p>"Turner and I were fishing for bass," Carter explained, "and he told me he was going to ask Fonda on a date". Carter then explained how he inspired Turner to go on with his plan, and a few years later, Turner and Fonda were married.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmqaVYrOwusOaZK2dlGLBtr7NnqlmqpWhrrW1zqeqoaGgYrqmwIytn6unpZy1brLOq6Seql2lv6a%2FyJ2cp6xdn7auudhmmpqqpJq%2Fbr7EpZitoZ%2BjwKm1z2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
