Derrig</strong>, <strong>Benoist F. Drut</strong>, <strong>Elena Frampton</strong>, <strong>Elizabeth Gill</strong>, <strong>Josh Greene</strong>, <strong>Ellen Hamilton</strong>, <strong>André Jordan Hilton</strong>, <strong>Adam Hunter</strong>, <strong>Ike Kligerman Barkley</strong>, <strong>Katie Leede</strong>, Leroy Street Studio, <strong>Leyden Lewis</strong>, <strong>Jeff Lincoln</strong>, <strong>Richard Mishaan</strong>, <strong>Rocky Rochon</strong> and <strong>Sara Story</strong>, as well as a kitchen designed by <strong>Bob Bakes</strong> of Bakes & Kropp Fine Cabinetry.</p><p>“For the house, we selected designers who are celebrated for their ability to create extraordinary rooms that showcase exceptional collections of art,” <strong>Jacqueline Terrebonne</strong>, Galerie editor-in-chief, said in a statement. “We were so impressed with the spaces they designed and how they incorporated work from today’s leading artists and galleries into their concepts.”</p><p>All of the designers involved in the project incorporated art into their individual rooms in a major way, using art from galleries including Salon 94 and Kasmin Gallery. Some artists even created site-specific installations for the property, <a href=#>which sits on six acres of land</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Sag Harbor is such <a href=#>a special place in the Hamptons</a>, and we were eager to bring together this ‘house of dreams’ where art and design intersect in such a fresh way,” Fuller explained. “It’s like nothing we’ve ever seen or experienced before: Our A-list lineup of artists, galleries, designers and artisans transformed this house into something new. It’s uncharted territory, and for creatives, they were challenged in a way that gave them total freedom to have new ideas and be inspired in different ways.”</p><p>The best part? It was all for a good cause. Proceeds from the show house will benefit the construction of a new East Hampton emergency department for Stony Brook Southhampton Hospital, which serves residents on the eastern end of Long Island.</p><p>The <a href=#>Galerie House of Art and Design</a> will be open to visitors through September 6.
